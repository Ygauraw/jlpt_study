Vocabulary: oneself

JLPT  Kanji      Reading	English
N5    自動車	 じどうしゃ    	Automobile
      自分	 じぶん		Myself, yourself, oneself, himself, herself.
      自転車	 じでんしゃ	Bicycle
N4    自由	 じゆう		Freedom, liberty, as it pleases you. (n, adj-na)
N3    自身	 じしん		By oneself, personally. (n)
      自然	 しぜん		Nature, spontaneity (n, adj-na, adv-to, adv)
      自動	 じどう		Automatic, self-motion (n,adj-na), intransitive verb
      自殺	 じさつ		Suicide (n, adj-no, vs)
      不自由	 ふじゆう	n, adj-na: 1) Discomfort, inconvenience
      		 		2) Poverty, want, destitution
				3) Disability, impairment (physical, mental, etc.).
      自慢	 じまん		n, adj-no, vs: Pride, boast.
N2    自ら	 みずから	n, n-adv: For one's self, personally.
      自宅	 じたく		n: One's home.
      自治	 じち		1) n: Self-government, autonomy
      		 		2) abbr: Local (governmental) autonomy.
      自衛	 じえい		n, adj-no, vs: Self-defense, self-defence.
      各自	 かくじ		n-adv, n-t: Individual, each
      自然科学	 しぜんかがく	n, adj-no: Natural science.
      自習	 じしゅう	n, adj-no, vs: Self-study.

Looking at the on-yomi for all of these, there are only two exceptions
to the じ sound:

* 自然 (しぜん), also in the compound 自然科学
* 自ら (みずから), kun-yomi

The kanji has other kun-yomi おの.ずから, おの.ずと which are N1 vocab:

N1  自ずから  	 おのずから  	adv: Naturally, as a matter of course.
    (Alternate writings: 自ら (おのずから))
    自ずと	 おのずと    	adv: Naturally.
    (Alternate writings: 自と (おのずと))

There are a few more N1 vocab worth learning:

JLPT  Kanji      Reading	English
N1    自己	 じこ		n, adj-no: Self, oneself.
      自信	 じしん		n, vs: Self-confidence, confidence (in oneself).
      自立	 じりつ		n, adj-no, vs: Independence, self-reliance.
      自転	 じてん		n, vs: Rotation (usu. on an axis), turning, spin.
      自動詞	 じどうし	n, ling: Intransitive verb (no direct obj.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vocabulary: self, 己

This is an N1 kanji so there aren't any compounds to learn. There are
a lot of compound words based on 自己, though, such as 自己紹介.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vocabulary: private, 私

There is an on-yomi (シ) but I don't think it's used. Just learn the
kun-yomi readings わたし and わたくし.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vocabulary: myself, 俺

There is an on-yomi (エン) but I don't think it's used. Just have to
learn kun-yomi reading おれ.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vocabulary: me, 僕

Interestingly, ボク is the on-yomi for this.

JLPT  Kanji      Reading	English
N4    僕	 ぼく		adj-no, pn, male
N1    僕	 しもべ		n: Servant, manservant, menial.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:

Only "oneself" (自) has any vocab associated with it, though it's
worth remembering 自己, too, since it occurs in so many compounds.

I was interested to see "intransitive verb" popping up. I've been
wanting to look up various grammar-related words, so now I can add
transitive and intransitive verbs:

JLPT  Kanji      Reading	English
N1    自動詞	 じどうし	Intransitive (self-driven!)
N1    他動詞	 たどうし	n, ling: Transitive verb (direct obj.).
--    自他	 じた		n: 1) Oneself and others.
      		 		   2) Transitive and intransitive.

I also note the homophones of じしん: it's either 自身 (N3, by
oneself, personally) or 自信 (N1, self-confidence).

Looking at tatoeba, we have examples:

自身:

Entry	Lang    Sentence
4562419	jpn	この本の翻訳ができるか自身がない。
        ---     No EN translation. Maybe mistaken for 自信
1008408	jpn	それは自分自身で作ったんですか？
        ---     No EN translation. <person> 自身 seems very common

自ら:

4865206	jpn	人々は普通、自らの理解[りかい]できないことは好きではない。
	eng	People usually don't like what they can't understand.
84749	jpn	父はいつも「天は自ら助くる者を助く」と言っていました。
	eng	My father always said that heaven helps those who help themselves
176748	jpn	君自らが会議に出席すべきであったのだ。
	eng	You should have attended the meeting in person.

It seems that めいわく would appear on the test either in hiragana or

Again, kanji will not be used, or will have ruby.

N3    拡大	 かくだい	magnification, enlargement, expansion, amplification.
N2    広げる	 ひろげる	vt, v1: alt: 拡がる (ひろげる)
      		 		￼ To spread, to extend, to expand, to enlarge, to widen, to broaden.
				￼ To unfold, to open, to unroll, to unwrap.
				￼ To scatter about, to spread around.
				￼ To make flourish, to cause to prosper.

N2    拡張	 かくちょう	expansion, extension, enlargement, escape, ESC.
N2    拡充	 かくじゅう	expansion.

So it appears that I only have to learn the カク on-yomi and ひろ kun-yomi.

Vocabulary: expand
Dictionary: expand, stretch, extend, lengthen, increase

JLPT  Kanji      Reading	English
N3    伸びる	 のびる		v1, vi: to stretch, to extend, to lengthen, to spread.
N3    伸ばす	 のばす		v5s, vt: to grow long (e.g. hair, nails).
N2    欠伸	 あくび		n, uk:
      		 		￼ Yawn, yawning (and stretching).
 				￼ Kanji "yawning" radical (radical 76). [ 欠 (あくび) ]

No point in learning on-yomi unless it happens to be part of a pure
signal. Just remember that the kun-yomi reading is の. Further, the 伸
びる/伸ばす verbs form a transitive/intransitive pair.

Note also similarity to 延ばす, which is an alternative writing for 伸ばす.
