<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</P>
<P>
The KANJD212 file is a comprehensive collection of information about the 
5,801 kanji in the JIS X 0212-1990 supplementary character set.
</P>
<P>
The basic philosophy and format of the KANJD212 file is the same as 
that in the  original KANJIDIC file, which covers the kanji in the
JIS X 0208-1990 set, and users are referred to the KANJIDIC.DOC file
for further information. This document only covers the unique aspects
of the KANJD212 file.
</P>
<P>
The KANJIDIC file is made available under the terms of the GNU Public 
Licence, a copy of which is appended to this document. As the GPL really
refers to software, and refers to source code, etc. a specific copyright 
statement based on the wording from the GNU Emacs Manual is applied 
instead.
</P>
<P>
<B>FORMAT</B>
</P>
<P>
As in the the case of the KANJIDIC file, the KANJD212 contains a mixture 
of ASCII characters and kana/kanji encoded in the EUC (Extended Unix Code) 
coding. The first three bytes of each record are the kanji itself, coded
in the EUC-3 method, in which the first byte is 0x8F. This is the main 
method of encoding the JIS X 0212 characters in EUC. The remainder of the 
fields in each record are in the same coding and format as in the 
KANJIDIC file.
</P>
<P>
<B>CONTENTS</B>

<B>COMMENTS</B>
</P>
<P>
Note that the bushu in this file are the "classical" versions, not the 
revised Nelson versions used in the KANJIDIC file.
</P>
<P>
<B>COMPILATION</B>
</P>
<P>
The KANJD212 file has been compiled from a number of sources:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the Unicode (UCS-2) mappings are from the table available  on
the Unicode Consortium's ftp site
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>the radical and stroke counts have been taken from the x0212-cn
file, one of a set of file prepared some years ago by Eric
Grinstead
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>the Morohashi numbers have been derived from the JIS X 0221
standards document, and are from the file Uni2Dict prepared by
Koichi Yasuoka <yasuoka@kudpc.kyoto-u.ac.jp>. The Uni2Dict file
covers all the Unicode 1.1 kanji.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>the Pinyin readings are from the Uni2Pinyin file, also prepared
by Koichi Yasuoka. His file was compiled originally from the 
"TONEPY.tit" file prepared by Yongguang Zhang, and has been
supplemented from other sources, including the x0212-cn file,
and the PYCHAR file by Christian Wittern.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>the Japanese ON and KUN readings are mostly from the file
of Unicode pronunciations (Pronunciations.text) prepared by
the Taligent company. They have been supplemented by some 300
additional readings from the Grinstead files, and by readings
collected from several waei jiten, and from the "hojo_wnn.src"
file prepared for use with the WNN FEP system.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>the Korean reading(s) have also been taken from the Taligent
file.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>the "Classic" Nelson numbers have been collected by Jim Breen,
and the "New" Nelson numbers are from the collection compiled
by Jen-Luc Leger.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>the SKIP codes have been generated by Jim Breen, in accordance
with the principles established by Jack Halpern.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>the itaiji cross-references are from the lists in the JIS X
0208 and JIS X 0212 standards. The original compilation was done
at ETL, and edited by Jim Breen
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>the meanings are derived from many sources, a major one being
the "unihan.txt" file from the Unicode ftp site. 
</LI>
</UL>
The compilation of the KANJD212 has really be made possible by the activities
of a group of people collecting material for a Unicode dictionary, and the 
assembly of the file is largely a by-product of that activity. The group is
led by Jack Halpern, and I would like to express my appreciation to Jack
and the other members of the group, in particular Koichi Yasuoka, Ken Lunde,
Martin Du"rst and Christian Wittern.

USING THE JIS X 0212-1990 CHARACTER SET
</P>
<P>
[Some comments by Jim Breen.]
</P>
<P>
Usage of the characters in the Supplementary Kanji set (which I will refer to 
here as JIS212 for brevity,) is not wide-spread. In fact, regular access to
these kanji is unlikely to become a feature of Japanese text processing
until the rather larger set of characters in the CJK portion of the 
ISO 10646/Unicode set is implemented widely. Why?, well they are pretty
obscure kanji, and it is very rare to find an occasion in normal Japanese
text-handling when the 6,355 characters in the JIS X 0208-1990 set will 
not suffice.
</P>
<P>
The only specific JIS212 font file I am aware of is the "jisksp16.bdf",
prepared by Koichi Yasuoka and others. My copy is Version 0.9 and is dated 
April 25, 1995 (ANZAC Day!). I have used this file to create the JIS21216.FNT
binary bitmap file for use with DOS applications.
</P>
<P>
As far as platforms supporting the JIS212 kanji, I have been able to 
ascertain as follows:
</P>
<P>
<B>A. UNIX</B>
</P>
<OL type="a">
<LI>MULE
<P>
The MULE (Multilingual Emacs) system supports JIS212 codes. I am not an 
emacs user, so I cannot comment much further. (I have been in touch with
Taichi Kawabata who has been working on the bushu/stroke count files
which are to be used in the formal merger of mule with (n)emacs. The
data files for these are derived from KANJIDIC &amp; KANJD212.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>kterm
<P>
The kterm (kanji xterm) can be made to support JIS212 by applying a patch
file "kterm-6.1.0-6.1.0.wd2.patch" to the X11R6 version of kterm. I have
successfully installed this within X11R5 under both Linux and DEC Ultrix.
This kterm version supports both JIS208 and JIS212 in JIS (ISO 2022) and
EUC codings, but does not support Shift-JIS at all. (I also encountered a
bug in the patch which I was able to fix, and the fix is now part of the
formal patch.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>WNN
<P>
I presume from the existence of the "hojo_wnn.src" file, which contains over
1,000 WNN henkan file entries of mappings into compounds of JIS212 kanji,
that there are versions of WNN which support JIS212. I have never got 
around to investigating them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>jstevie
<P>
I am an old `vi' user, and desperately wanted to be able to edit files 
containing JIS212 kanji using a vi-like editor. As I use jstevie under both
Linux and Ultrix, I asked Junn Ohta, who did much of the kanjification of
stevie, for some suggestions, and following his advice, I produced a version
of jstevie which will edit EUC files containing JIS212 (and JIS208) kanji. 
Of course it will not handle Shift-JIS, and I haven't got around to doing a 
JIS version, although only a few changes are needed for this. Of course, it 
needs the special version of kterm.
</P>
<P>
I'll get around to releasing this version someday, but if anyone wants a
copy to try, please email me.
</P>
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>xjdic
<P>
Of course, I needed to be able to use my own dictionary system with JIS212 
kanji, so I have extended the xjdic and xjdxgen software to handle files
with JIS212 kanji. This was released as part of V2.2. In this version, the
file was treated as another dictionary file.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 V2.3 of xjdic was released, with support for the JIS X 0212 kanji
as part of the main kanji dictionary file. In this mode, KANJIDIC and 
KANJD212 are merged to operate as a single file.
</P>
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>yudit
<P>
Gaspar Sinai's "yudit" editor handles JIS X 0212 kanji quite successfully,
as ca be expected because it uses Unicode internally.
</P>
</LI>
</OL>
<B>B. MacIntosh</B>
<P>
I am not aware of any software which handles JIS212 kanji on Macs. Bear
in mind that the JLK and Kanjitalk software uses Shift-JIS, which cannot
support JIS212.
</P>
<P>
<B>C. Windows.</B>
</P>
<P>
As for Macs. (I have suggested to Stephen Chung that he extend JWP to 
support JIS212 kanji. JWP and WinJDic are among the very few pieces of
Windows software that use EUC coding internally.)
</P>
<P>
<B>D. DOS.</B>
</P>
<P>
The Japanese version of DOS (DOS/V), and the NEC PC-9800 versions all use
Shift-JIS, and hence cannot support JIS212.
</P>
<P>
I have modified my JREADER text reader program to support files with JIS212
kanji. It can also reference kanji in the KANJD212 file. This was released
as part of V2.6. At the same time JDIC was extended to handle JIS212 kanji,
however it does this by treating the KANJD212 file as one of its dictionary
files, not as part of the kanji database.
</P>
<P>
<B>E. WWW Servers</B>
</P>
<P>
As far as I know, the only WWW server supporting the JIS212 kanji is my
own WWWJDIC dictionary server. It supports a combined JIS208 and JIS212
in the same way as xjdic (above.) Initially I just treated the JIS212 kanji
the same as the JIS208, as Netscape on a Sun at Monash (where I have the 
JIS212 fonts installed in the X11 server) displays these correctly. However
as most users do not have this capability, I created 5,801 transparent .gif 
images of the JIS212 kanji, and send them out instead.
</P>
<P>
<B>F. WWW Browsers</B>
</P>
<P>
As described above, Netscape on a Unix system satisfactorily displays the
JIS212kanji, provided the fonts are insalled in the X11 font server.
Similarly, I have been able to displaythese kanji using the "lynx"
text browser.
