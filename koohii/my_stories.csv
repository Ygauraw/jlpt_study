306,軌,"rut",1,2016-06-08 10:13:13,"Albert Einstein said that the definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. That's a serious rut in one's thinking.

308,喩,"metaphor",1,2016-06-08 10:25:04,"Some topics in Japan are not really spoken about in direct terms, and so people speak in metaphors instead. The first people to mouth these was probably an association of butchers who wanted to sell their wares without offending people by talking directly about flesh and cutting and so on directly.

311,各,"each",1,2016-06-08 10:32:20,"It's hard to remember something as general as ""each"", so I mime letting my fingers do the walking over my mouth. To each his own, I guess."
312,格,"status",1,2016-06-08 10:38:19,"In theory, communism is supposed to do away with ideas of status. It's supposed to be ""to each according to his needs, from each according to his ability"". In practice, the best they have achieved is to give a tree to each person."
313,賂,"graft",1,2016-06-08 10:40:42,"The amount of graft in Cambodia is terrible. Every government employee is on the take, from teachers to doctors to police. To get by, you have to shell out to each one of them in turn."

315,客,"guest",1,2016-06-08 11:17:24,"Japanese use the same kanji to mean both ""guest"" and ""customer"". Each of them is under your roof, in any case, so you will treat them properly as a guest."

318,処,"dispose",1,2016-06-08 11:30:37,"Think about the improper ways of disposing of litter. Nobody shits on their own doorstep, but it's surprising the number of people who will use their walking legs to move just a little bit away and let the wind dispose of it for them.
Think of the long stroke under wind as them making the minimum effort to get away from their doorstep."
319,条,"twig",1,2016-06-08 11:36:09,"Think of a bonsai tree. It's so tiny that you can even use your fingers as walking legs and walk right over the tree. If the tree is that tiny, imagine how small the twigs must be!"
320,落,"fall",1,2016-06-09 16:53:22,"Think of the falling of cherry blossom petals. The flowers at the top fall like drops of water. The funny thing is that #each# of the blossoms seem to fall at around the same time so the Japanese make a special festival out of it: hana-mi"
321,冗,"superfluous",1,2016-06-08 11:50:45,"Think of the primitive for wind and give it a secondary meaning of ""desk"" (机). Now imagine crowning it with another wooden covering. How superfluous!"

324,輝,"radiance",1,2016-06-08 12:07:03,"Thinking back to ""army"", all the rays coming out of the regal palanquins (crowned cars) are probably the reason that we don't see any of the grunts: the amount of radiance simply blots out everything else from view."
325,運,"carry",1,2016-06-08 12:15:03,"One of the main reasons that the influence of the Roman empire carried so far is that they engaged in a massive amount of road-way building to carry their armies."
326,冠,"crown",1,2016-06-08 12:20:41,"The crowning achievement of royalty is duping the people into thinking that, even from the beginning, a kind of divine right is attached to the crown."

My Japanese gardener is very industrious but he doesn't speak English well. When I asked him the other day to dig a pit, I went out later and found a huge mound of soil and a top hat beside it. When I lifted up the top hat, I heard a huge howling wind from under it. It seems that my gardener had misunderstood the scale of the pit that I wanted (more like a cavern!), but at least I am thankful that he put the top hat on top so that nobody would fall in."
330,享,"receive",1,2016-06-08 12:49:26,"The received wisdom is that if a child receives good nutrition, he will grow up to be tall."
331,塾,"cram school",1,2016-06-08 12:59:49,"I imagine cram school to be some kind of high-tech indoctrination method. There's some sort of transmitter that pumps out something that's received by anyone around it. I've never been in there (too scared) but I've peeked over the enclosing mound of soil and seen it happen with my own eyes."
332,熟,"mellow",1,2016-06-08 13:08:06,"The tall kids and the round ones never could get on together, but after sitting with each other at the campfire, their attitudes began to mellow and mature. The fire mellowed them out and let them receive a more rounded world-view."
333,亭,"pavilion",1,2016-06-08 13:17:46,"Pavilions are grand things, but there can be a lot of pettiness on the part of their designers. In the competition to see who can build the tallest, one guy I know just crowned his with a nail. It looked stupid, but it did make it taller than any other pavilion!"
334,京,"capital",1,2016-06-08 13:22:07,"The capital is where you see the biggest inequalities in society. The tall (the rich) tower over the small (the poor). I guess that's capitalism for you."

337,鯨,"whale",1,2016-06-08 13:32:46,"In warfare, we talk about ""capital ships"". In nature, the ""capital fish"" must be a whale. Of course, it's a bit backwards to call a whale a fish (ie fish-capital, not capital fish)."
338,舎,"cottage",1,2016-06-08 13:39:52,"Whereas a lord can have all his wants satisfied completely (全), subsistence farmers have much more meagre cottages: just an umbrella and a small plot of land (a cottage garden) to feed their mouths.
With ""lidded crock"": under a humble cottage with only an umbrella for a roof, the inhabitants fill their lidded crocks with kimchi for the winter. (making kimchi in lidded crocks is a true cottage industry)"
339,周,"circumference",1,2016-06-08 13:51:07,"Between the times when manholes were invented and the time when manhole covers were perfected, people tried all sorts of weird ideas, including using lidded crocks as a hood for the hole.

342,吉,"good luck",1,2016-06-08 14:08:01,"This represents the deluxe ""samurai"" version of a plain lidded crock. Most of the ""good luck"" that people ascribed to it at the time would most likely be explained away today by our knowledge of microbes and bacteria and such. The tighter-fitting lid meant less contamination, so the samurai had the ""good luck"" to avoid many food-borne maladies."
343,壮,"robust",1,2016-06-08 14:13:51,"So far, nobody has been able to give me a robust explanation of how four turtles came to be samurai. And don't try to give me the story of their gentlerat trainer, either. (teenage mutant ninja turtles)"
344,荘,"villa",1,2016-06-08 14:19:20,"I think of the grand French villas (though more like palaces to you and me) like in Versailles, with the elaborate flower gardens guarded by imported turtle samurai. This flowering of rococo excesses must have seemed so robust before the revolution."

350,津,"haven",1,2016-06-09 12:28:41,"Think of The Great Wave off Kanagawa, the ukiyo-e by Hokusai. See the way he paints all that water and spray with his brush? Then notice that there are some boats out there! They need to find a haven from these waves."
351,牧,"breed",1,2016-06-09 10:09:27,"Taskmaster forcing cow to breed. It sounds cruel, but if nobody forced cows to get pregnant, we wouldn't have milk all year round."
352,攻,"aggression",1,2016-06-09 10:11:30,"It's a crafty taskmaster that uses just the right amount of aggression: not too much that the slaves can't work, and not so little that they start getting ideas about mutiny!"
353,敗,"failure",1,2016-06-09 12:27:11,"Back in the 80's, Maggie Thatcher said (to paraphrase) ""only failures take the bus"". I disagree, Maggie: the real failure is let money become your taskmaster"
355,故,"happenstance",1,2016-06-09 12:25:06,"Heisig's talk of ""fate"" here is completely wrong! Kismet (fate) and happenstance (coincidence) are two completely different things.

467,諦,"renunciation",1,2016-06-11 11:33:19,"A good example of a very public and historic renunciation by a sovereign: At the end of WWII, the speech of the sovereign (Emperor Hirohito) renouncing their war effort marked the official surrender of Japan to the Allies."
468,童,"juvenile",1,2016-06-11 11:37:20,"heh. fat angry German kid stood up and jumped on his computer just cos he lost a game. I'm sure if you look up 'juvenile' in the dictionary, they've got a link to the youtube video."

472,嫡,"legitimate wife",1,2016-06-11 12:41:56,"My legitimate wife is a bit of a relic (antique), but I wouldn't leave her for my mistress.
For ""antique"", I think of something that has endured (stood from) old, with the enclosure around ""old"" taking on a somewhat grammatical or syntactic role like a topic marker or connective/grouping word like ""old thing #that# (still) stands up"" or ""concerning this particular old thing, stands up"" instead of Heisig's literal ""hood"" or ""glass canopy"" idea."
473,適,"suitable",1,2016-06-11 12:48:34,"It's easier to trigger a memory of something that is not suitable, so imagine an antique Model T Ford puttering down the motorway. All the other drivers are angry and want it to drive some place more suitable."

478,匂,"aroma",1,2016-06-11 14:04:23,"I think of packaged curry roux or stock cubes here. In just a spoonful, there are so many flavours (but don't think that---different kanji!) and aromas bound up, just waiting to be released.
Alternatively, to avoid thinking ""flavour"" think of aromatic herbs like basil or mint. You can preserve the aromas of these by blanching the herbs and freezing them in an ice cube tray. Then, when you want to add some aroma, pop one out onto a spoon and put it into the pot and stir to release all the bound-up aromas."

All the colours of the spectrum (ROYGBIV, that's all of them) can be compared by splitting white light with a prism.
Be careful not to confuse with every, each. This is most often used for ""all people"", so maybe ""people of all colours"" can help remember the spectrum (not rainbow, though, as that's insect-craft)
Also, compare/contrast with descendants. I remember the top dot of white by thinking of a ray coming out into compare, plus only white light (not the sun) has a complete spectrum."
485,楷,"block letters",1,2016-06-16 12:35:17,"Think of this in terms of ""movable type"" printing presses. This involves lots of carved wooden blocks--one for #all# the letter of the alphabet.

488,渇,"thirst",1,2016-06-15 13:05:30,"water + ""beggar"". ""beggar"" = sun casting a light on a ""bound up"" empty spoon. So I think of the RHS as casting light on some sort of specific lack that's begging to be fulfilled. Make sure not to picture a beggar lying down or you'll get confused with beg.
In this case, the lack is water, so this ""beggar"" character is thirsty as that's the meaning ""bound up"" in his empty spoon in this context.
Careful with drought (similar EN) and dwindle (kind of similar story)"
489,謁,"audience",1,2016-06-11 15:16:09,"The beggar's empty spoon in this kanji is begging to be filled with words, so he wants an audience with someone (that is, be given the chance to talk with them)"
490,褐,"brown",1,2016-06-11 15:19:21,"The ""beggar"" metaphor breaks down here, since he isn't literally looking for garments (a cloak) to fill his empty spoon. But lets say that he's not fussy and any scraps will do. Then when you mix all the colours of the garments together (like Play Doh in his magic spoon), you just end up with brown.
Alternatively, brown is a pretty boring colour, but beggars can't be choosers."
491,喝,"hoarse",1,2016-06-11 15:23:31,"The beggar's spoon is looking for a mouth, meaning the ability to speak. This simply means that he's hoarse."
492,葛,"kudzu",1,2016-06-11 15:38:36,"The beggar is highlighting a specific lack of flowers. Perhaps that suggests kudzu because that plant can spread rapidly through underground stolons without needing flowers and seeds.
Or perhaps he wants to see flowers, but they all have been choked by kudzu vines?
The first story is probably more accurate (botanically speaking), but the second might be easier to remember."
493,旨,"delicious",1,2016-06-11 15:44:29,"spoon-sun/day

494,脂,"fat",1,2016-06-14 10:07:51,"Think fats in meats, not being fat.
Long, slow cooking of the flesh renders down the fat and renders it even more delicious. 
""render"" repeated to reinforce that fat is a noun, not an adjective, also dual meaning to help remember ""rendering (melting) fat"" and ""rendering (making) the flesh more delicious"""
495,詣,"visit a shrine",1,2016-06-11 15:50:45,"I think of offering bowls filled with delicious fruits. So when visiting a shrine, it's proper etiquette to leave a little delicious offering after you say your prayers."
496,壱,"I (one)",1,2016-06-16 12:45:10,"There's a very famous Japanese book ""I am a cat"". It's narrated by the cat and he uses very high-faluting language (like ""wagahai ha neko de aru""). Here we see how the cat sees himself: as a refined gentleman, sitting down wearing his crown.
OK, I'm confused. This ""I"" is the Roman numeral for 1. I got confused because ""one"" is also a more formal way to talk about yourself (""one is"", not ""I am"").
This kanji doesn't have the sense of the first person singular at all! I'll have to come back to this later."
497,毎,"every",1,2016-06-11 16:06:50,"According to Freud's Oedipal theory, every (not each!) male child wants to lie down with his mother. (thanks to decamar0n, KameDemaK)"

Cunning Oedipal/BDSM imagery aside, #every# #taskmaster# needs a certain kind of cleverness with the whip: to know that it is not the whip itself, but the threat of it that is most important. The slave may only feel the whip occasionally, but the threat of it looms over #every# moment."
499,梅,"plum",1,2016-06-14 10:14:53,"#Every# plum tree is a plum tree, but not #every# plum tree is a plum tree.
Two meanings of plum:
1. the fruit of the plum tree
2. a highly desirable specimen
Putting it this way (as two apparently contradictory statements) forces you to remember the most natural word between ""all"", ""each"" and ""every"". To my mind, ""every"" is the most logical word to express and solve the contradiction in English."

503,腹,"abdomen",1,2016-06-11 17:06:28,"Technically, お腹 is one's stomach, but the kanji also has the meaning abdomen, so that's fine.
In fact, the abdomen is where the intestines doubles back on themselves so that makes it easy to remember.
I guess ""doubled back"" (or ""doubled over"") could be remembered by thinking of riding an imaginary bicycle. You lie down, point your legs towards the sun and then start moving your walking (cycling) legs. This move certainly doubles over your tummy when you do it."

506,吹,"blow",1,2016-06-11 17:28:55,"True story: yawning isn't actually for getting more oxygen in through your mouth, it's for blowing excess carbon dioxide out."
507,炊,"cook",1,2016-06-11 17:36:47,"Lacking metal cooking pots and such, many cultures (eg, Hawaiian) would build a big, yawning pit and use it to cook in.
Alternatively, the kanji for ""lack"" can be seen as a ""lacuna"", or gap, so this symbolises directly a primitive fireplace (a gap for a fire) specifically for cooking."

515,賠,"compensation",1,2016-06-12 10:19:14,"The shell is effectively ""hush money"" to compensate them for some loss.
""muzzle"" isn't exactly a traditional reading. Looking at kanji where it appears, it kind of looks like it has a meaning to do with being like a tool of empire, like a yoke or muzzle that's imposed because the populace aren't very civilised and they need this for their own good. Mind you, I'm just making this up from compensation and the two kanji that follow."
516,培,"cultivate",1,2016-06-12 10:24:17,"soil-muzzle. If you want literal, cultivating the soil requires you to put a muzzle on it so that nobody can hear it scream when you plough it up.
If you look at a muzzle as being more of a tool of enforcing civility on an unwilling subject, then cultivate has a double-meaning that fits here: you're literally cultivating the land (growing stuff in it) and also making it more fit for the needs of civilisation (moving it away from its wild state)."
517,剖,"divide",1,2016-06-12 10:32:06,"more imagery of the tools of empire or subduing a populace for their own good. Muzzle dissent and use force (the sword) to divide and conquer the populace. 
Although the sword is on the right, it seems that this is just due to the right being the normal position for it, regardless of the kanji's meaning.
Divide and conquer is also a problem-solving technique. Break the problem into smaller pieces, and only work one small chunk at a time, muzzling (ignoring) any details from the other pieces."
518,音,"sound",1,2016-06-12 10:35:27,"When singing, making a speech, and so on, it's best to stand up so that the sound from your wagging tongue reaches everyone. No point sitting down and mumbling!"

In nursery rhymes (and other poetry in general) all sorts of nonsense sounds are employed. We don't mind if these sounds aren't proper English if they're employed to make things rhyme nicely.

Or think of ""employee"" in the sense of someone who is ""in service"". Then it's easier to explain that some sounds are only used ""in service"" to the rhyme, even though they may not make sense outside of it."
521,識,"discriminating",1,2016-06-12 10:56:56,"A vuvuzela is a more modern version of Heisig's kazoo. Ever heard a kazoo at a fiesta (like the World Cup, for example)? Me either. So for me, vuvuzela is a more memorable keyword for ""sound fiesta""
discriminating: a person with discriminating tastes prefers a nice quiet chat over the shrill vuvuzela sounds of the World Cup fiesta.
(discrimination in the sense of having more picky/choosy/discerning tastes rather than the more negative connotations of discriminating against someone)"
522,鏡,"mirror",1,2016-06-12 11:00:11,"metal-mirror. Speaks for itself, really. You need silver on the back of glass to make modern mirrors, though before it would be solid lumps of polished metal.
For some reason, Heisig breaks down the primitive on the right as standing, sun/wagging tongue, human legs. That's crazy given that ""stand up"" and ""see"" immediately gives the image of standing up and looking at yourself in a full-length mirror."
523,境,"boundary",1,2016-06-12 11:05:57,"true story: Archimedes had the idea of using an array of mirrors set up on the boundary of their land to reflect sunlight onto the sails of invading ships so that they would catch fire. So just picture mirrors set up on big mounds of soil to protect the boundary.
postscript: mythbusters tried this and didn't really come to a conclusion except to suggest that it was within the boundary of what was possible given the Greek's technology at the time."
524,亡,"deceased",1,2016-06-12 11:11:57,"Maybe pictorially as someone who has just perished peacefully while lying back in his chair. The deceased still has his top hat on, and his jaw has dropped open.
Interestingly, although this looks like an enclosure, I don't think it's ever used as one. Just as well, because I get a bit squeamish about the idea of putting stuff into a dead man's gaping mouth."

527,荒,"laid waste",1,2016-06-12 11:32:25,"Laying waste is stronger than just destroying something temporarily. It's like ""salting the earth"" so that not only will the current crops die, but nothing else will grow.
Flower + flood is like some temporary disaster, but if there are no flowers, there can be no fruit, so by embedding ""perish"" in this picture too, it's like all hope of a future harvest perishes here, not just the flowers! Further, imagine the bare fruit trees that are left and see that they are the deceased thing in this story."
528,望,"ambition",1,2016-06-12 11:51:42,"""As famous as the moon"". A man works hard to gather a large bag of rice, which he ties to the roof with a rope. His ambition causes him to imagine the rice making him rich. In his daydream he imagines having a child and giving them the auspicious name. A rat gnaws on the rope. The rice falls on him, killing him instantly.

529,方,"direction",1,2016-06-12 12:02:03,"Remember 2nd keyword of ""compass""
I advise not to use a story for this. Rather, look at kanji for ten-thousand, sword and bound up (plus any other that you have problems distinguishing) and learn them as a group based on their shapes.

Christians talk about ""grace"", meaning to be free from sin. If you believe that then taking up the Christian faith is supposed to be what causes your heart to find this ""grace"".
Personally, I don't believe it, but I have the good grace not to cause a fuss with people who wear their cause over their hearts for all to see.
Note: while people talk about a ""state of grace"", don't confuse with heart on the left.""State of mind"" seems logical, but you'll get the kanji wrong!"
653,応,"apply",1,2016-06-15 13:26:29,"My parents told me that if I applied myself, I could be anything I wanted to be. In my heart and soul, I knew I wanted to be the Batman! So I brought my heart down to the bat-cave to apply."
654,意,"idea",1,2016-06-17 12:58:41,"Read from bottom to top, an idea starts like a feeling in the heart/mind, then we try to put it into words and finally it ""stands up"" as a distinct thing itself.
Shorter story: ideas are the sounds we hear in our mind when we care to listen.
Distinguish from ""think"""
655,臆,"cowardice",1,2016-06-14 14:35:30,"Think of a coward as someone who wants to ""save his own skin(flesh)"" So preservation of the flesh becomes the overriding idea.
Be careful when reading the kanji that you don't get sucked into thinking that ""flesh-idea"" means something like lust, sensuality or whatever. I guess thinking of the fight-or-flight response can help fixing this idea."
656,想,"concept",1,2016-06-14 14:37:43,"Inter-mind: you need some kind of shared concepts/power of conceptual thinking as a basis for any inter-mind communication."
657,息,"breath",1,2016-06-15 13:29:38,"self (control) over heart
Breathing is normally controlled by the autonomic nervous system, so we don't have to think about it. We can take control #ourselves# if we want to.
It's also possible to self-control your own #heart# rate by breathing exercises, meditation and such.
In more mundane cases, self-control of one's breath is the first step in handling panic attacks (where quickening heart-rate leads to spiralling anxiety)"
658,憩,"recess",1,2016-06-14 14:51:50,"Recesses of the mind. Imagine your tongue probing at a cavity (itself a kind of recess). Now apply that in a more metaphorical sense, with the same tongue probing your #self# in order to find that particular thing that you know is lurking down there in the recess of your mind."
659,恵,"favor",1,2016-06-27 21:13:49,"Think about how this kanji has the same top part (ten fields) as speciality
How did the specialist get there, besides sticking to his studies?
From the start, his specific specialities must have found some sort of favour in his heart.
So in other words, the specialist has some sort of vocation that favoured his success in these ten fields where others might have failed.
Difficult to find (ten fields), free and well-favoured (heart)"
660,恐,"fear",1,2016-06-18 07:51:12,"Fear is the mind killer. It crafts a mediocre heart."
661,惑,"beguile",1,2016-06-14 15:13:19,"Robin Hood's impressive display at the ""range"" (with earth on the left) moves on to a different stage. Now the people really take him to their hearts, beguiled by his skill and panache."
662,感,"emotion",1,2016-06-14 15:19:13,"A march of mouths coming up from the heart. We know the idea of a ""stream of consciousness"" with its march of ideas. This is the emotional equivalent, with a march of wordless mouths (or ineffable words) coming up from the heart."
663,憂,"melancholy",1,2016-06-14 15:26:13,"Summer should be a time of happiness but this guy exudes an air of melancholy. You've heard of such people--they ""wear their heart on their sleeves"". Only in this case, the guy (a Japanese Hamlet, perhaps?) wears his heart on a belt and puts a crown on it.
Alt: the king of the country & western singers (whose songs are always melancholy) from the land where it's always summer (Texas, I guess) has a special belt buckle made so he can display his heart and his crown to everyone."
664,寡,"widow",1,2016-06-17 12:59:18,"Think of a black widow spider. We have roof, head and dagger. Whose #head# is it?
I think it's the widow's #head#. She is #head# of the house, for one. Also, the elongated last two strokes of head suggest long-flowing hair which she uses to conceal the #dagger# intended for her next mate."
665,忙,"busy",1,2016-06-14 15:36:52,"Picture the state of mind of the over-worked salary-man, over-busy with long hours and commuting and it's not hard to imagine that his heart ends up feeling like it's already dead"
666,悦,"ecstasy",1,2016-06-14 15:42:04,"ecstasy the drug. State of mind recollecting Bacchanalian / Dionysian orgies, replete with the obligatory satyrs (horned ""devils""). Just the sort of thing your parents warn you about!"
667,恒,"constancy",1,2016-06-14 15:45:10,"If the rendering of heart on the left usually indicates flux in one's state of mind, this is the exception. The heart retains its constancy for the whole span.
So think of constancy in opposition to flux and remember this exception."
668,悼,"lament",1,2016-06-14 15:48:26,"State of mind + eminent.
Think of how you feel when someone you admire (as opposed to love) dies. Say David Bowie. Most of us, having never met this eminent man, don't mourn exactly, but rather lament his passing. That's the right feeling here."
669,悟,"enlightenment",1,2016-06-16 13:49:28,"State of mind + ""I"". This ""I"" is self of the five senses. Enlightenment is the realisation of the inherent emptiness of self, allowing us a glimpse of our ""original mind"" which is beyond this self.
This kanji summarises the idea of enlightenment from the first verse of the Heart Sutra:

Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva
when practicing deeply the Prajna Paramita
perceives that all five skandhas are empty
and is saved from all suffering and distress

(skandhas = ""piles"", so ""I = ""five piles"")"
670,怖,"dreadful",1,2016-06-15 13:33:49,"state of mind + linen.
I described ""linen"" in terms of ""airing your dirty linen/laundry/towels out in public"". Whoever does that must have a dreadful state state of mind. It's also dreadful for anyone exposed to it."
671,慌,"disconcerted",1,2016-06-14 16:10:36,"state of mind + laid waste.
Being disconcerted is like having a very bad sinking feeling. It's too much to process all at once, like (as people have suggested) looking at the devastation caused in New Orleans.
It's not just shock, because you know you've failed to take it all in, and that realisation is what's *really* disconcerting."
672,悔,"repent",1,2016-06-14 16:19:14,"state of mind + EVERY
I take a more Buddhist view of repentance that it means to try to be present in every moment. There is not so much the idea of sin wrapped up in this. Instead, a balance between the vow to follow the Eightfold Path and the accompanying ""repentance"" which is a fulfilment of that vow. Trying to be present in every moment is also called Vipassana (or Mindfulness) mediation."
673,憎,"hate",1,2016-06-18 07:53:37,"State of mind + Sir Humphrey/""former""
The state of mind of Sir Humphrey after being fired from his former job is just pure hate for everyone except himself. Probably just like Hitler after becoming a former art school student.
Think also the book, 1984. I'm sure civil servants came up with the idea of the ""two-minute hate."" Or if not, they certainly administer it, wanting to instil this state of mind of hate in everyone."
674,慣,"accustomed",1,2016-06-14 16:29:32,"Have you seen those guys who pierce their faces as part of a custom. Do they feel the pain? I think they don't really and and that this state of mind is simply because they've become accustomed to the act of piercing."
675,愉,"pleasure",1,2016-06-17 13:03:12,"pleasure = state of mind + butchers
It might help to think about the word ""savour"" (pleasure is a kind of savouring). From there, to ""savoury"", making the connection to savoury things, like the butcher supplies. (also umami, the savoury flavour in cooked meats)."
676,惰,"lazy",1,2016-06-14 16:40:48,"Forest Whitaker has a ""lazy"" left eye. The right side of the kanji reminds one more of a stroke, though (full body/flesh).
I imagine the state of mind of laziness as being taking some minor setback (like a lazy eye) and magnifying it (as if it affects the entire left side of your body, for example) so as to use it as an excuse not to do something.
Oh, and Forest Whitaker definitely doesn't strike me as the lazy type, despite his lazy eye!"
677,慎,"humility",1,2016-06-14 16:45:06,"For ""true"" I use the idea from open source that ""given enough (let's say ten) eyes, all bugs are shallow"" and derive ""truth"" from that through the act of using the principle as an actual tool (toolbench at the bottom).
Using the same sort of story, if you release your code and let others look for bugs in it, the proper state of mind you will arrive at is ""humility"" since those ten eyes will no doubt see things that you failed to see."
678,憾,"remorse",1,2016-06-14 16:57:08,"state of mind + emotion
Read the RHS as ""emotion"", not ""emotional"", otherwise you'll mix this one up.
I said that emotion is like a march of wordless mouths/ineffable words coming up. If you stew in this state of mind, you begin to shape it into thoughts like ""I should have done"" or ""I shouldn't have done""---the very image of remorse.
I also like the point made that 'emo' is part of remorse."
679,憶,"recollection",1,2016-06-14 17:01:29,"state of mind + ideas
contrast with remorse, which deals with recurring (past) emotions. Here there's no march, just a state of mind in which your heart is serving up ideas of past things."
680,惧,"disquieting",1,2016-06-14 17:04:31,"Think of dentistry tools all laid out beside you when you sit down in the big chair. That sort of state of mind is pretty disquieting."
681,憧,"yearn",1,2016-06-14 17:18:24,"state of mind + juvenile
Trying to separate out shades of meaning between yearning, longing, pining and hankering. Of those, longing is the closest in meaning to yearning. I see yearning for something in the future, with longing belonging more the the past.
So, yearning is the state of mind I felt when listening to the song ""500 miles"" as a juvenile. Never did get the girl I yearned for, but that's ok."
682,憬,"hanker",1,2016-06-14 17:31:43,"state of mind + scenery
ZAMM: state of the mind hankering after a particular bit of scenery--that of a wide body of water, as seen from the back of a car or motorbike. Hankering is funny, though, because it's not exactly clear that you'd actually do anything with the scenery as you gaze out on it. Satisfying a hankering can be a strangely unfulfilling state of mind!"
683,慕,"pining",1,2016-06-14 17:35:50,"graveyard + valentine
I suppose you don't pine for anyone as much as a lost love. I wonder if the dog at the bottom of graveyard is pining for his lost love? It does seem like dogs pine like we do, so maybe ..."
684,添,"annexed",1,2016-06-15 13:36:38,"water on the left, heaven over valentine
Think of Andie MacDowell (female lead) in Four Weddings and a Funeral... the ""is it still raining"" bit. Imagine the equally corny dialogue ""heaven just annexed a place in my heart for my #valentine#"" while, yes, it is still raining.
Remember ""valentine"", not ""heart"" in the bottom right."
685,必,"invariably",1,2016-06-14 17:53:21,"Abstract kanji and keywords invariably make it difficult to find good stories.
One thing I have found, though, if a woman wears a seatbelt across her heart, it invariably accentuates the shape of her breasts."

690,我,"ego",1,2016-06-14 18:41:16,"think of a micro-managing boss who wants to have a hand in every aspect (from top to bottom) of fiesta preparations."
691,義,"righteousness",1,2016-06-14 18:45:10,"Think Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction. He's following his path of righteousness (his famous speech includes ""the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."") donning a sheep (to blend in with his flock or something). His ego is already there if you look for it, but we have to ""bring it out"". Consider the ego involved in just making up bits that aren't even in the Bible... or considering himself to be a modern-day messiah or something"
692,議,"deliberation",1,2016-06-14 18:55:16,"say-righteous. Let's imagine Samuel L Jackson as the image of righteousness from before and go with it. A key moment of deliberation in the film is between Jules (Jackson) and Vincent about the righteousness (or lack thereof) of giving ones boss's wife a foot massage. So it's say (left side) + righteousness."
693,犠,"sacrifice",1,2016-06-14 19:04:52,"Cow + Righteousness, with Jules as R.
Think ""sacrificing of ones principles"", not animal sacrifice.
Jules is just this sort of righteous man. So no eating pigs, but he is more than happy to eat cow on several occasions (big kahuna burger, plus his interest in McDonalds/Burger King burgers in the Netherlands)
If animal sacrifice pops into mind, remember that there are three animals in this story (sheep from Jules, pig from the principle he won't sacrifice, and cow on the left). That might help."

In the case of damaged goods, you should usually be pointing the finger at the employee rather than the customer.

743,及,"reach out",1,2016-06-15 14:30:11,"Contrast scary image of a fist, and this third stroke that reverses the meaning, turning it into something positive.
So imagine landing a boat in a new country late at night and seeing a giant fist reaching out to you. Then the fear vanishes when you realise they're holding out a rope so that you can moor yourself. How nice to meet someone reaching out to help on your first day."
744,吸,"suck",1,2016-06-15 14:34:17,"Suck
To suckle is immediately obvious. A baby's mouth reaching out for milk."
745,扱,"handle",1,2016-06-15 14:48:35,"finger-reach/finger-outstretched hands
These seemingly-easy kanji are actually probably the hardest to remember.
I'm going to remember a particular handle: that of a large window. A burglar sees that a smaller window above it is opened so he climbs up and manages to catch the handle of the big window with his fingers after stretching his hand out as far as it will go."
746,丈,"length",1,2016-06-15 14:55:30,"For the primitive, ""arm"" or ""tucked under arm"", I'm imagining the down-stroke to be the arm, and the stroke across it, an umbrella or such (held in place above the elbow between the body and the arm)
For this one, we effectively have 1 (suggesting counting) and arm, giving the idea of a cubit (often the length between the wrist and the elbow) or similar.
Maybe imagine the architect with his blueprints still tucked under his arm as he measures the length with his forearm."
747,史,"history",1,2016-06-15 15:00:15,"First point: this is actually supposed to show the ""mouth"" is actually tucked under the arm (not above it)
Second point: the kanji has meanings ""history"", ""chronicle"" and (most importantly) ""history of a country"".
So, imagine this mouth to be an abbreviation of the kanji for country, and if you're able to put it under your arm, it's obviously not the country itself but a history of the country."
748,吏,"officer",1,2016-06-15 15:03:43,"Staying with the idea that ""mouth"" is actually an abbreviation of ""country"" (as in history), let the stripe at the top denote a rank.

749,更,"grow late",1,2016-06-15 15:06:59,"Sun below line already seems to indicate that it's growing late.

750,硬,"stiff",1,2016-06-15 15:12:21,"stone + growing late

751,梗,"spiny",1,2016-06-15 15:16:27,"tree + grow late
As it grows late, the trees cast weird shadows, reminding one of angular, spiny creatures invading your bedroom like cracks of dark ice breaking through and overtaking normal reality.

755,隻,"vessels",1,2016-06-15 15:37:55,"Not drinking vessels, apparently (because it would be yucky to drink out of turkey crotches).
So, imagine a car ferry (that kind of vessel) made by hollowing out a giant turkey and the cars driving into its crotch to board. Well, it's not so far from the idea of swan boats for paddling about in, just on a larger, more commercial scale."
756,護,"safeguard",1,2016-06-15 15:52:54,"say-(flower, vessels/turkey-crotch)
This word appears in the naval manual under ""safeguarding the ship""
The intended meaning was that a priest should say a prayer first and then sprinkle flower petals on deck before setting off.
The mates were illiterate so when they saw the word, they brought along a turkey as a mascot, putting flowers in its hair and calling it ""Judy Garland"". Since they didn't understand what the word meant, the turkey's crotch received no safeguard from the sailors attentions."
757,獲,"seize",1,2016-06-15 15:56:33,"Poor old Judy Garland (flower over turkey). With that pack of randy seamen (see safeguard) pursuing her and seizing her so roughly all the time, her crotch just seized up."

I guess ""explaining ""missile"" in terms of ""throw"" is best:
An Uilleann Pipe (Irish bagpipes) is inflated by sticking it under your armpit and I'm using it like a sonic weapon. This covers missile: a crotch-powered wind instrument being used to fire awful sound-missiles. 
Since no air escapes until you press the button with your fingers, your fingers are what ""throws"" these sonic missiles around."

770,枝,"bough",1,2016-06-15 17:07:04,"My story for branch uses it in the sense of a branch of a business (a brothel, to be precise, since I read ""ten crotches""). So ""bough"" is somewhat secondary and needs to have a tree put in front of it to narrow down that particular meaning."

So I'm going to think of a Maypole. The top part is a picture of the streamers, while the earth beneath probably represents fertility/the Earth mother (or just a gathering ground)
Sticking with pagan interpretations, the flowers represent blooming/fruition, and the streamers coming down are the stalks of the flower heads, connecting the dancers to this unified life-force."
773,怪,"suspicious",1,2016-06-15 17:42:17,"state of mind of a maypole spinning round by itself. It's like you're alone in the universe and the streamers represent your thoughts/essences flowing away. It's not a pleasant state of mind, but yet you don't want to leave and connect with other people because you view the outside with suspicion and fear.
Also think horror films with an empty carousel at night, going round and round. Again, the air of suspicion all around, and you feel trapped on the carousel due to this state of mind."

Remember that the left side also appeared in relatives.
I like the explanation that uncle is a kind of ""crotch-mate"" by proxy (from the same family line). If you go up the family tree to your parents, then look at the ""littler"" ones that came out of the same crotch (your grandmother's), then they should make ideal uncle material."
776,督,"coach",1,2016-06-15 17:54:58,"A good coach casts an avuncular (ie, uncle-like) eye over his charges. Never too strict, but always trying to encourage you to do your best."
777,寂,"loneliness",1,2016-06-15 17:57:23,"We might think of an ""old maid"" as being the symbol of loneliness, but I guess that in kanji, it's the uncle living in his house alone without a wife. Easy."
778,淑,"graceful",1,2016-06-18 07:59:42,"Juxtaposing with the idea of loneliness, perhaps the old maid has come to terms with her isolation (dealing with her loneliness with good grace) and finds a slow, graceful rhythm to her life. I would guess that this could be symbolised by water by either her flowing manner or from the way her attitude shows right from the start of the day with her morning ablutions.
Note the graceful form of the kanji with just three tall strips side by side. No need to remember complex positioning."

Anyway, whether they scream or not, it's easy to see why trees might be anti-planks.
To distinguish from ""lumber"", consider ""anti-"" as meaning ""as against"" or ""as opposed to"" in this case. So we have tree - lumber - plank. Tree and plank are at the opposite ends of this spectrum, so plank is a more anti-tree thing.than lumber."

There are two kanji for listen. This is the one for listening attentively, as to a concert. So, the ear and heart (heartfelt/sincere) are easy to remember.
Let's say that you're interested in picking up every nuance, so you're listening in  every frequency range at once, and that ""ten nets"" are like ten neural nets connected to the hairs in the cochlea that physically allow us to hear different frequency ranges."

Hard to see how ""state of mind"" applies and Heisig gives no clues.

Apparently the top three together means ""as a term of comparison""

So to remember the top part, consider it as either/or: would you rather have a roof over your head, love (heart) or a means of employment (here, as a net, indicating a fisherman, remembering ""teach a man to fish"" proverb). So summarise choices as ""house, heart or halibut"""

Difficult because it's a linguistic term. Muddied would be better, but mud is taken as a keyword.
Imagine bound up insect as vocal chords, water representing the air (a fluid) coming from your mouth. Casting a net over outflow somehow ""voices"" the consonant by confining it temporarily then releasing it in a controlled way.

At least once he's finished, he'll get to alternate with the other husband, so it's not all bad."
911,臣,"retainer",1,2016-06-17 17:52:47,"I'll use different sense of ""retainer"" to remember the kanji (a pictograph of an orthodontic retainer, with stuck-out tongue, in a mouth) but I'll remember the ""pop-eyed (awe-struck) retainer"" thing from Heisig, too, especially since he uses it in a secondary sense as ""slave"" (or perhaps ""retinue"")"
912,姫,"princess",1,2016-06-18 08:42:47,"OK, woman-slave is OK, but woman-retainer is easier to remember. Princesses are the female heirs that they keep around (#retained#) just in case something happens to the male heirs and she has to become queen.
Be careful not to think woman + alternate, even though that makes sense with the story above.
Alternative: it wasn't that uncommon to swap princesses to use as hostages to ensure that two opposing kingdoms kept on good terms. Think of them as being effectively slaves, albeit well-pampered ones."
913,蔵,"storehouse",1,2016-06-17 18:03:35,"flowers - parade - slave
The slaves have to wear flowers for the parade, so they have to requisition them from the storehouse (filling in forms in triplicate) and get them back in perfect condition straight afterwards or they have to pay a forfeit."
914,臓,"entrails",1,2016-06-18 08:43:42,"When I said that slaves have to get the flowers back to the storehouse on time after the parade or face a forfeit, this is the kind of forfeit I meant--you can see the entrails of all those who failed to get back in time strewn all around the storehouse. You know, ""pour encourager les autres""
Remember the flowers. They have to go back to make the storehouse ""whole"" again after the parade. If they don't, I'll have YOUR entrails."
915,賢,"intelligent",1,2016-06-18 08:24:12,"slave and crotch over shell (money). Quick version: it's not intelligent to put sharp shells down your loincloth.
Going with the idea of slave + crotch = loincloth, as several people suggested.
Idea of: Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit, wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad"". (no, no, tomato)

Mutatis mutandis: ""#intelligence# is knowing that shellfish come from the sea, wisdom is knowing not to eat any come from a loincloth""
(practically the only place they have to hide their ""clams"")"
916,腎,"kidney",1,2016-06-18 08:26:00,"loincloth-flesh
Well, those loincloth-clad slaves can surely spare a kidney if us rich folk need one sticking into our own flesh. They have two, after all!
Usually flesh seems to go on the left. Think about stomach, though and squint to think of the two parts of loincloth as being two different kidneys giving a kind of anatomical pictograph."
917,堅,"strict",1,2016-06-17 19:14:02,"thinking ... solid, reliable, dependable, stricture ... keeping strictly within lines...
I'll come back to it.

918,臨,"look to",1,2016-06-17 18:33:11,"""look to the future"" immediately comes to mind. Here, imagine a Roman slave who can look forward to a life of freedom and citizenship if he serves his period of indenture. Here, he looks to a life of recumbent ease, eyeing a stack of goods, his new possessions.
(note that ""look to"" can be inferred both by the slave and his ""popping"" eye and the fact that he is laying down over the goods, keeping a watchful eye on them)"
919,覧,"perusal",1,2016-06-18 08:28:36,"slave beside ""reclining, one/floor"", all over look
On close perusal, the slave realises that his reclining self is not the same as the floor. Therefore, there is something lower than himself.
Note, on closer perusal, the two different ""eye"" themes, with plain old ""look"" being dominant (""pop-eye"" aspect of retainer/slave, being the other). You could even see ""two with a dot"" in the top-right corner, too."
920,巨,"gigantic",1,2016-06-17 18:38:42,"Reminds me of a cyclops, which could have been giants, but it's easier to think of them with gigantic EYES instead."
921,拒,"repel",1,2016-06-18 08:29:41,"Poke a cyclops in the eye with your finger ... good way to repel them.
Or maybe ""repel someone's advances"" with a finlonger (device to make your finger longer) or oversized (gigantic, even) foam finger.
Remember we're repelling a gigantic cyclops, not a pesky little slave."

926,劣,"inferiority",1,2016-06-18 08:31:38,"Inferiority places your own sense of ""few"" (few opportunities, few contacts, few monies, etc) over the sense of the real potential of your own powers. The few control the power of the many, even though they are less powerful than those they control!
Remember it's nothing to do with heart/state of mind. It's a more direct juxtaposition of few + power, so the person really is in an inferior (subjugated) position: it's not just in his head."
927,功,"achievement",1,2016-07-10 16:18:11,"The recipe for achievement is to combine craft and muscle (brains AND brawn).
Ultimate achievement: chess-boxing (yes, it does exist, strangely enough). Mohammed Ali died recently. I'd say he would have been great at chess-boxing cost he had the craftiness and the power. (as a hook to remember... huge achievement, 3 time world champion)"
928,勧,"persuade",1,2016-06-17 18:59:04,"pegasus-power
Mafia films always talk about the idea of ""persuading"" someone to go along with their plans. Imagine the power of persuasion they'd have if they had a pegasus. The power to drop someone from the back of a pegasus makes for a very persuasive argument."
929,努,"toil",1,2016-06-21 18:10:02,"Guy (woman crotch) over power/muscle
I'm going with an image of ""Rosie the riveter"", as pictured in the WW2 propaganda poster. She's wearing a factory uniform and red and white polka-dot bandana, with sleeve rolled up showing her bicep:

Different from ""rising up"""
931,励,"encourage",1,2016-06-18 08:51:25,"Remember the idea of ""persuade"" and its use a mafia-style euphemism? Now think about the French expression ""pour encourager les autres?"" So we see quite a few people just chucked off a cliff (immeasurably many, or just 10,000 if you want to count). Why? Because it gives you #power# over anyone else who might oppose your rule, of course."
932,加,"add",1,2016-06-18 08:56:36,"Add a mouth (ability to charm, perhaps?) to raw muscle and you've got a powerful combination!
Remember also achievement, which seems to express a similar idea, but ""muscle"" is on the other side of that.
Also, could this kanji have added not one but two characters to the katakana script? (カ and ロ) (based on some stories below)"
933,賀,"congratulations",1,2016-06-18 08:59:06,"(muscle-mouth/add) over shell
congratulatory collection envelope passed around at work, each person adds more shells."
934,架,"erect",1,2016-06-18 09:02:12,"add over trees
Thinking of erecting a radio transmitter? Adding it on top of a tree will give the erection extra height for not so much effort.
I guess the way of thinking of a radio transmitter as a ""powerful mouth"" could also work as a dual interpretation."
935,脇,"armpit",1,2016-06-18 09:08:17,"flesh which is at the confluence of three muscle groups (in arm, chest and back?)
Contrast with threaten. Flesh is to the side here."
936,脅,"threaten",1,2016-06-18 09:08:43,"flexing bulging muscles to threaten someone. Think Popeye flexing muscles saying ""why I ought ta!"" Flesh underneath the muscle is small relative to muscles themselves and acts as a reminder that it goes here, rather than on the left.
Remember this is different from bully and intimidate. Also contrast with armpit, which is the same except it has flesh on the left."
937,協,"co-",1,2016-06-18 09:11:59,"needle (or ten) beside triceps
Think of words like ""co-prosperity"" and ""co-operation"". They seems to imply some sort of synergy. That is, where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. That idea of synergy is easily seen if you look at the needle on the left as ""ten"": get an effective strength of ten muscles by bringing together just three."

I need some exercise to restore my flat belly. Perhaps going with the ""air bicycle"" exercise in double back will restore my fitness?

941,得,"gain",1,2016-06-18 09:22:47,"going, nightbreak, glue
Think ""no gain"". All pain, none of the gain. Then think of that as wage slavery. The person has to keep going, starting at nightbreak (another word for dawn!) and stick to it all day for little or no gain."
942,従,"accompany",1,2016-06-19 15:11:36,"column, animal horns, mending
Think of an adorable mascot (like a Funzo with animal horns) walking along beside a column of troops, mending their spirits as he accompanies them.
I tend to think ""devil"" at the right with this story, so remember to concentrate on why they have a mascot (mending spirit/mood) and not what it looks like (apart from the horns)"
943,徒,"junior",1,2016-06-18 09:29:33,"column, run.
Lots of different meanings associated with this kanji!
Think of a very ""junior"" rank in an army, that of an errand-boy or message-carrier. He has to run up and down the length of the advancing column carrying scrolls filled with idle chit-chat being passed between squad leaders (and maybe some important messages, too)"
944,待,"wait",1,2016-06-18 09:33:13,"going, temple

Normally I read ""lord"", not candlestick, but in this case I'm make an exception for the journey of the Olympic torch as it goes all around the place (including from country to country, so we get two ways to fix a journey in our minds)
Also, try to remember it's ""going/column/line"" rather than a roadway."
946,征,"subjugate",1,2016-06-18 09:37:43,"column, correct
A Japanese army column passing through Manchuria, subjugating the populace and forcing them to learn them the correct stroke order for correct as it goes. (so it goes!)"
947,径,"diameter",1,2016-06-18 09:38:53,"go-maypole

948,彼,"he",1,2016-06-18 09:41:12,"go pelt

949,役,"duty",1,2016-06-18 09:45:15,"going + missile
Duty is like #going# off to be cannon fodder (or at least #cannon-ball#, fodder since the right side is #missile#) because ""your country needs you"" or some crap like that."
950,徳,"benevolence",1,2016-06-18 09:50:23,"going + ten-net heart, similar to ""listen"" (with heart/intent)
Say you go around donating ten nets and teaching people how to use them out of the goodness of your heart. (""teach a man to fish ..."")
To bring listen (with heart/intent) + benevolence together, say you go around teaching people how to really listen to classical music as a form of benevolence (to enrich people's lives)."
951,徹,"penetrate",1,2016-06-18 09:57:30,"column, bring up (rear), taskmaster
Difficult primitives to work with because ""bring up"" only has the sense of raising young.
So, think sleeper agents. This is a secret ""fifth column"" that is raised (like a cuckoo smuggled into the nest) among the normal population, but secretly indoctrinated by their taskmasters/handlers.
A particularly insidious form of penetration.
Note similarity with ""remove"" and maybe consider that as removing the ""brainwashing"" that has penetrate the kid's psyche here."
952,徴,"indications",1,2016-06-18 10:08:28,"Thanks, thecite. I'll go with your idea of the top three components representing a ""trek"" (I like the word ""overarching"" to describe both the grouping and the kanji's shape)
trek: go under the shadow of the mountains as directed by some taskmaster.
So kings on a trek, overarching indications/signs, let's say it's the three wise men following indications (signs) in the sky. Ineffable taskmaster in this case, but the way events are conspiring it seems like some guiding hand is at play."

960,程,"extent",1,2016-06-18 11:32:39,"wheat and display
Think vast grain-fields (wheat on the left). Their sheer extent is what allows the king to pay for this ostentatious display of his on the right (a new gold grille for his teeth on top of the hugely ostentatious sceptre he's resting his chin on). Just as there seems to be no extent to the grain fields, neither is there any extent to his crassness."
961,税,"tax",1,2016-06-19 15:13:32,"Different from levy, which is a tax for a standing army.
Imagine a tax designed to subsides wheat farmers so that the country is self-sufficient and doesn't have to be dependent on imports (from countries we may not always be on the best terms with). How is this different from a levy? Well the devil is in the details!

a shift in agricultural practices in ancient Egypt (with granaries to store the grain that could feed the populace many times over) led to the rise of a great empire and marked a huge shift in human history. (I guess you could call it an agrarian shift/revolution)
so... shorter version: shifts to agrarian agriculture, over-production, shift in human history"
965,秒,"second",1,2016-06-18 11:56:17,"wheat, few ... second
We already have sand, grains of sand, now this, with wheat on the left.

They are even enticed to take the words of children into account (thanks to the writings of King James I in England and his treatises) when conducting these trials.
Hilarity ensues (not).

Provisions for a work/school day. Think bento box and the way there's a good ratio of rice and other contents. A good balance is achieved with:
3 parts rice (carbohydrates)
2 parts protein
1 part fruit and veg"
996,菊,"chrysanthemum",1,2016-06-18 14:16:43,"I'm assuming that rice is included here because the chrysanthemum has lots of petals. More than 8, but there's no other kanji with more than 8-fold symmetry.
Flower is obvious, rice can be explained, so remember bound up: look at the plant and all the petals are all tightly bound up together, like a dahlia's"

1001,漆,"lacquer",1,2016-06-19 15:31:47,"Apparently the right side of this means ""cut at intervals"": trees are cut into logs, umbrellas into segments and rice grains into convenient package sizes, I guess.
I'm going to assume that lacquer comes from trees (urushi tree in Japan) and that the sap (the water radical on the right) is collected in the same way that latex is gathered from rubber trees, with cuts made at intervals up the trunk.
Looking up pictures for urushi tree does show regularly-spaced cuts, so I think this theory might be correct."
1002,膝,"knee",1,2016-06-19 15:32:28,"body and ""cut at interval"" (see lacquer). The knee cuts the leg into two more or less equal intervals."

Think of The Blue Brothers film. The crowd wasn't happy with the blues set they were doing, so they started firing arrowheads at them.

If you could time-travel like Hiro, you could cheat with however many women as you wanted to, by just popping off and spending a few days with them somewhere in time.

1031,悠,"remote",1,2016-06-20 12:40:51,"Hiro + walking stick + taskmaster over heart
Comparisons with Zatoichi or Daredevil might seem remote, but at heart they are all the same (think of the two blind fighters with their walking stick and the pursuit of justice as being the same #taskmaster# for all three)."

1035,伏,"prostrated",1,2016-06-19 17:14:53,"prostrated: hiro + dog

1036,伝,"transmit",1,2016-06-19 17:20:15,"Hiro + rising clouds
Hiro is worried that his time travel will transmit ripples that will disrupt the underlying space-time continuum.

1037,仏,"Buddha",1,2016-06-19 17:23:14,"Hiro + Elbow
With his time-travel ability, isn't it strange the Hiro never went back to kill Hitler (anti-Buddha, which is the hook for remembering) or rub elbows with the Buddha?"

1039,仮,"provisional",1,2016-06-19 17:25:19,"Hiro + anti-
For a while, Hiro distrusts Ando-san because he saw a future timeline where he becomes an anti-hero. However, this is only provisional and they become buddies again."
1040,伎,"performing artist",1,2016-06-19 17:31:22,"Hiro + branch
Sometimes Hiro branches out and uses his powers to perform some magic tricks. It's not all about saving the world."
1041,伯,"chief",1,2016-06-22 12:06:16,"Hiro + White
I mishear this (deliberately) as ""chef"" and I imagine Hiro baking a cake (not his metier) for someone, and getting loads of white flour on his face.
Also, when Hiro goes back to feudal Japan, he meets ""Chief Whitebeard"""
1042,俗,"vulgar",1,2016-06-19 17:37:44,"Hiro + valley
vulgar as ""vernacular"" (common) speech as opposed to ""high"" speech.
It's all hinted at in the kanji without needing Hiro. It's ""low"" speech, so let's say that the people of the valley are less refined because they are both literally ""low"" and because the come into contact with a lot of sailors coming upstream from the ports to trade. Just remember that it needs to fit with ""person"", so think ""vulgar person"""
1043,信,"faith",1,2016-06-19 17:44:44,"Hiro + words.
You can always have faith in Hiro's words. He will always do what he says he will."
1044,佳,"excellent",1,2016-06-19 17:51:13,"Hiro + ivy (square jewel)
I think of Bill and Ted (two other time travellers) and their admonition to ""be excellent to each other"". That's the segue into Hiro, and this time we think of the web of connections across timelines looking like ivy, if was graphed (they kind of did that, denoting all the timelines with string at one point). Think also of time travel as a strand (of ivy) that connects Bill and Ted to Hiro."
1045,依,"reliant",1,2016-06-24 10:42:05,"Hiro + garment
Hiro is not reliant on a magic garment for his super-powers: they're innate. Unlike, say, ""The Greatest American Hero"" TV show."
1046,例,"example",1,2016-06-19 17:55:55,"Hiro + file (as in ""single file"", ""rank and file"")
Although we don't have superpowers like Hiro, he still serves as a great example to us, the normal rank and file."
1047,個,"individual",1,2016-06-19 18:05:44,"Hiro + harden
We meet two distinct Hiros (two individuals) in the series. One is the happy-go-lucky individual who is obsessed with  superhero and the other a battle-hardened warrior from the future."
1048,健,"healthy",1,2016-06-19 18:44:59,"Healthy = Hiro + building
Waffles: the building block of a healthy body."
1049,側,"side",1,2016-06-20 20:56:22,"Imagine ""side bet"" at a poker table, which is something that's worked out between different players. Different venues will have different rules to say whether and how side bets are allowed."
1050,侍,"waiter",1,2016-06-19 18:49:00,"Hiro + Buddhist Temple
There's only a slight drop differentiating wait and waiter. One has to do with a person, so that must be the one with person radical on the left."
1051,停,"halt",1,2016-06-24 10:43:45,"Hiro + pagoda
You see this at bus stops (halts), so imagine Hiro bringing a fold-up pavilion where he can sit and meditate or something until the bus arrives."
1052,値,"price",1,2016-06-19 18:52:00,"Hiro + straightaway
Hiro is a man of honour and he would never disrespect you by haggling over price (even if it is expected behaviour) and always pays the asking price straight away."
1053,倣,"emulate",1,2016-06-19 18:53:01,"Hiro + set free
Emulate your hiro/hero to set yourself free from a mundane existence."
1054,傲,"arrogance",1,2016-06-20 12:43:37,"An arrogant person believes that there is nobody that he should emulate, but that people should emulate him. Therefore, he throws dirt on anyone following a different direction.
Compare with emulate and think that people following this arrogant person is having any idea of being #set free# (in mind, spirit) is going to have dirt heaped on that idea."
1055,倒,"overthrow",1,2016-06-24 13:10:40,"Hiro + arrive
Whatever timeline Hiro arrives in, you know that he will overthrow the villains there.
Or imagine a population struggling under a cruel dictator and think of ""come the hour, come the man"" (the man will arrive at the right time)"
1056,偵,"spy",1,2016-06-19 18:59:51,"Hiro + upright
Sometimes Hiro has to spy to get information. You would think that this would be against his upright character. Perhaps it is, and perhaps that's why we see him crouching down, hiding behind things quite a bit."
1057,僧,"Buddhist priest",1,2016-06-19 19:05:15,"Hiro and Sir Humphrey (former/increase)
Talk about differences in character. I will go with my memories of Buddhist priests across Asia and note various hypocrisies (chasing after women, money and drink or hanging out in shopping malls or buying the latest action films in pirate video shops) to remember this striking contrast."
1058,億,"hundred million",1,2016-06-19 19:06:52,"Hiro + idea
The idea of hundred million years. Just the idea, then that leads to the idea of time travel, as personified by Hiro."
1059,儀,"ceremony",1,2016-06-27 21:04:54,"ceremony = Hiro + righteousness
Just like Data has a cat called ""spot"", Hiro has a cat called ""Ceremony"". It's a pretty self-righteous cat since he doesn't like anyone standing on him."
1060,償,"reparation",1,2016-06-19 19:18:46,"Hiro + prize
Reparation as something done to set right an injustice.
In this case, Hiro struggles long and hard to set right the injustices done to Charlie (whether by fate or by Hiro's own actions). The PRIZE of this reparation is the person for whom this reparation is being undertaken: Charlie herself."
1061,仙,"hermit",1,2016-06-20 12:53:33,"Don't need Hiro for this. Obvious kanji."
1062,催,"sponsor",1,2016-06-20 12:57:11,"Hiro over mountain-turkey
Think of Heroes crossed with Mini Ninja game. There are various NPC ""turkeys"" dotted around the game who are kind of sponsors of your quest. In the first scene, you come down from the mountain and meet the first of them."
1063,仁,"humanity",1,2016-06-20 12:58:58,"Hiro just because he's a generic representative of humanity. Then think of two lines:
""Oh, the humanity""
""Oh, the huge manatee!""
That's your ""two"" right there."
1064,侮,"scorn",1,2016-06-20 13:02:43,"Hiro + every
Every time I find another kanji with such a similar meaning (scold, rebuke, chastise, revile, ridicule, whatever), I feel like I'm going back to the beginning.
I'm sure Hiro would just have a scornful laugh every time such an obstacle presents itself, being determined to overcome the problem every time."
1065,使,"use",1,2016-06-20 19:00:44,"use: hiro + officer
Think first of ""abuse"", then ""abuse of power""
Hiro uses his powers like a police #officer#, ""to protect and serve""
(alternatively think ""use of weapons"" (Ian M. Banks novel) -> ""[ab]use of power"")"
1066,便,"convenience",1,2016-06-20 13:10:50,"hiro + growing late
As it was #growing late#, Hiro failed to get to the convenience store before closing time. Using his time travel ability, he just went back ten minutes earlier to buy his groceries: how convenient!"
1067,倍,"double",1,2016-06-20 13:19:27,"Hiro + muzzle
Hiro has his double come back from the future, but think of another double: that of the protagonist in Dostoevsky's The Double. This double is much more confident than the main character, who feels muzzled by this more confident self (or, doubly) that he could muzzle the double as an attempt to deal with his own inadequacies)
So here I'm using the double meaning of ""Hiro"", that of ""Hiro Protagonist"""
1068,優,"tenderness",1,2016-06-20 13:45:04,"Hiro + melancholy
The most tender parts of Hiro's story (those with Charlie) are tinged with melancholy since we know that she will die and Hiro can't save her."
1069,伐,"fell",1,2016-06-20 13:55:30,"Person, fiesta
In the season finale (a kind of metaphorical fiesta?) it's Hiro who actually fells Sylar by running him through with his sword. Maybe imagine the large open space that is the setting as being like a fiesta ground, with the orange sculpture in the middle of it being a float?"
1070,宿,"inn",1,2016-06-20 13:58:17,"Roof over Hiro + 100
Hiro attends a superhero convention with 100 other people at a Holiday Inn near an airport (they never hold these conventions anywhere nice; it's always just someplace convenient to get to)"
1071,傷,"wound",1,2016-06-20 14:02:59,"Hiro + lying-down piggy-bank

Imagine the Black Knight scene from Monty Python. The reclining piggy bank refuses to yield despite the many amputations he has suffered from Hiro's sword. ""'tis but a pork scratching!"" it squeals as it rolls around in the mud."
1072,保,"protect",1,2016-06-20 14:15:10,"Hiro, mouth-tree
Going with idea of ""mouth-tree"" as ""dumbfounded"" or ""dumbfounding""
Hiro is protecting the space-time continuum, which is represented with the dumbfounding image of a giant mouth radiating power at the top of a tree (think Illuminati except instead of an eye atop a pyramid, it's a gaping mouth floating above a tree)"
1073,褒,"praise",1,2016-06-30 10:25:04,"Stack of top hat, protect and scarf
Compare to ""back"", which has ri (computer) instead of protect here.
I have to praise that tinfoil hat I started wearing. It has protected me from all those signals beaming into my brain. (ie, replace the computer in the back of the labels with something to protect.
High praise/cannot praise highly enough -> tinfoil hat -> protect against signals beaming into brain."
1074,傑,"greatness",1,2016-06-20 19:17:07,"Hiro beside ""full measure"" over tree
We didn't really appreciate Hiro's full greatness until we saw the full measure of the danger he protected us from spewing from the mouth of that tree in ""protect"".
Think ""full greatness"" -> ""full measure"" and then remember the full measure of difference between this and protect.(not a great difference)
OR: you may not realise the full measure of a man's greatness until he's lynched in a tree (think of the death of Archimedes at the hands of a Roman soldier)"
1075,付,"adhere",1,2016-06-20 15:51:28,"To adhere is simply another word for glue to, but it's more something that a person does (eg, adhere to a path)"
1076,符,"token",1,2016-06-20 19:08:43,"bamboo + adhere
Those who adhere to the system of bamboo stick-fighting (kendo? SA stick fighting?) are really only engaged in a ""token"" martial art. It's more for fun/show than really being all that practical.
In fact, kendo swords are actually made of four pieces of bamboo, held together with leather straps. So with this token bit of knowledge, we might be able to get the primitives of bamboo and glue (represented by the straps)."
1077,府,"municipality",1,2016-06-20 16:00:23,"bat-cave, adhere
I think of the film Ikiru. The municipality officials (in their bat-caves, just like in ""government office"") just want to ""pass the buck"" but Watanabe realises that he wants his life to mean something so he assiduously adheres to the cause of getting the swamp drained so the local children can have a playground. After he's dead, all the politicos and officials adhere to the line that it was a group achievement and that Watanabe only played a small part."
1078,任,"responsibility",1,2016-06-20 19:12:14,"Hiro + porter
Hiro carries his responsibility without grumbling, just like a good porter carries bags without complaint.
Also, let's go with spider man, with great power comes great responsibility. Think of the shared root between porter, a message with great import[ance] and a duty to carry out (ie, a porter)"
1079,賃,"fare",1,2016-06-20 16:05:44,"responsibility over shell.
fare as in some kind of charge paid for with money.
Think of places where paying the correct fare (charge) essentially operates on the honour system. It's then each person's own sense of (social) responsibility that makes them pay the correct amount of shells."
1080,代,"substitute",1,2016-06-21 18:07:35,"Think of Hamlet, who considers substituting the ""slings and #arrow(head)s# of outrageous fortune"" for suicide, only to worry ""in that sleep of death, what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil."" He may be #substituting# one hell for another."
1081,袋,"sack",1,2016-06-20 19:22:26,"Sackcloth may substitute for proper garments if you have nothing better to wear."
1082,貸,"lend",1,2016-06-20 16:21:36,"substitute-shell
When you lend someone money, it is only a temporary substitute for them actually owning that money.
Also, in English, we use the phrase ""to sub someone some money"". This literally means to lend to them. It usually comes with the expectation that the money will soon be repaid, eg, ""Can you sub me until pay day on Friday?"" Again, think of it as a temporary substitute for you having your own money (on pay day)"
1083,化,"change",1,2016-06-20 16:53:00,"Hiro-spoon
We fear change. Well, change ""change"" to ""spoon"" and that's Hiro: he fears spoons. Why? Because as a child he was never taught to use one, only chopsticks."
1084,花,"flower",1,2016-06-20 16:35:40,"flower over change.
Flowers as harbingers of the seasons (and its changes)"
1085,貨,"freight",1,2016-06-20 16:39:10,"change over shell
Imagine shipping through various countries and the various different currencies (shells) that you have to get at the foreign exchange to pay for the changeover between different local freight carriers."
1086,傾,"lean",1,2016-06-20 16:41:07,"Change beside head.
When you're leaning towards an idea, it means that you haven't changed your head (standing in for mind) in that direction just yet."
1087,何,"what",1,2016-06-20 16:42:28,"What can Hiro do? What, indeed..."

The ""what"" guy in pulp fiction (""'What' ain't no country I've ever heard of!"")  is pushing up the daisies. He won't be packing his baggage to go to What-land any time soon."
1089,俊,"sagacious",1,2016-06-20 16:48:45,"person beside licence, walking legs

1090,傍,"bystander",1,2016-06-20 16:54:48,"person beside stand, crown, direction
This guy is just a bystander. He can't move in any particular direction to help because he's balancing a vase on top of his crown."
1091,俺,"myself",1,2016-06-20 16:58:37,"person dog-eel
Pretty much the most vulgar form (ore) that men use to refer to themselves. Machismo based around dick size seems to feature with a dog with an eel for a dong suggesting itself.
Interesting to see how the final dot of ""dog"" seems to combine into the last stroke of ""eel"", too, like some sort of surgical attachment."
1092,久,"long time",1,2016-06-20 17:00:44,"ひさしぶり

For third-class passenger sections, they get twice as many people inside by splitting the available vertical space so that each passenger's head is right up to the ceiling. Also, there are no chairs, just a long seatbelt that passengers are required to wear at all times (to stop them falling on the person beneath)."
1097,柄,"design",1,2016-06-20 17:18:00,"Tree, third-class
Design like on a decal. So thinking like that, we can get the idea of a veneer: a wood-effect sticker that's stuck on 3rd class wood to ""spruce it up"" (a type of tree, get it?)."

1108,瓦,"tile",1,2016-06-20 20:24:09,"I think that image is good if you consider the mathematics of tiling. It's all over the place, but conveys a work-in-progress, trying different angles/shapes so that things will fit together properly.
Ceiling: existing tiling you want to connect to
Plough: jut out to try to fill new space (digging into it)
Hook: see if this tessellation hooks into another space that's already occupied
Dot: If not, fill in that entire area

1111,営,"occupation",1,2016-06-20 20:28:48,"We already had ""post"", which presented a horrible kind of job. This one is similarly bad.

1112,善,"virtuous",1,2016-06-20 20:30:33,"Contrast with Righteous. Instead of ego at the bottom we have some free-floating animal horns and a mouth. I'm seeing an image of the virtuous man abandoning ego and even distancing himself from meat and exploitation of animals in general."
1113,膳,"dining tray",1,2016-06-21 18:03:23,"""Dining tray"" seems to have the sense of a person living alone. So we're probably talking meagre, virtuous meals, taken off this single table, just enough #flesh# to sustain the body."
1115,夜,"night",1,2016-06-20 20:34:37,"Decomposition mostly says it all. Top Hat (""wherever I lay my hat ...""), person that had walking legs, but now they drop. So kind of like an itinerant dropping his hat and sleeping where-ever he can once night falls."

For Cash, think about the paradox of being able to split money (by making change with lower denominations) but not literally (as in a shredder). Then apply the towel: towels of all sizes from bath to hand, but you don't shred that, either"

The Islamic religion has a very well-defined idea of alms-giving. Indeed the first public hospitals (in the modern sense) were build in Islamic countries.

Think of a carousel with lots of ribbons/banners and a whole zoo of different carved animals to ride.

1136,塀,"fence",1,2016-06-21 15:15:41,"soil, flag over puzzle.
Think of the four-colour (map colouring) puzzle. Kanji shows earth, representing each country, then ""flag-puzzle"" is the puzzle of putting one of four flags into each patch of ground so that no two adjoining countries share the same colour flag. In other words, each fence has to separate two patches of ground with different colours."

Cobbler's flag, promises to restore your footgear to working order.

1139,握,"grip",1,2016-07-17 14:06:12,"finger-roof

Contrast to ""gully"". Say that's built for run-off, to carry water away (or was created by water finding its own way). Now think of an irrigation ditch, where the soil is there to stop the water from ""yielding"" (which we can think of literally as ""leaving the field"")."
1143,居,"reside",1,2016-06-21 15:32:58,"The place where you reside is more of a permanent ""residence"", whereas ""to dwell"" is just where you happen to be living.

Exhaust in the sense of ""deplete"", ""use up""
I'm going to forget about ""ice"" and treat it as two drops, so we have the idea of using the last drops. A shakuhachi player puts so much effort into his performance that you can literally see that he's used up (exhausted) the last drops of his energy by the end of it."

Also has meanings of ""furnace"", ""kiln"" and ""reactor""(!). All those make more sense than ""hearth"", which suggests an open fire (fireplace) to me. Anyway, what with smoke-free coal (like anthracite) being more commonly used, modern fireplaces (ok, hearths) all have a door to stop the noxious fumes from escaping."

1189,袖,"sleeve",1,2016-06-21 19:33:35,"Topologically speaking, a cloak is just a sheet with two holes. If those holes were stretched out, the cloak sprouting sleeves, as it were, the result would still be topologically isomorphic."
1190,宙,"mid-air",1,2016-06-21 19:34:26,"Imagine something just appearing in mid-air (out of thin air). It would be as unlikely as Brussels sprouts sprouting up in your home."
1191,届,"deliver",1,2016-06-21 19:38:05,"flag over ""wherefore"" (ie, for what reason"".

1192,笛,"flute",1,2016-06-21 19:38:56,"You can't use fully-grown bamboo plants as flutes (though you could use them for lots of other things). Instead, you need to find the right-sized shoot."
1193,軸,"axis",1,2016-06-21 19:41:30,"Think axial symmetry and this vehicle should cause this kanji to shoot from your mind just like that."
1194,甲,"armor",1,2016-06-21 19:43:59,"Pictograph of a shield, maybe? Anyway, it's not too hard to remember given that ""wherefore/sprout"", ""armour/root"" and ""speaketh/monkey"" all form a set that you can learn all together."
1195,押,"push",1,2016-06-21 19:46:08,"Think of a push in Tai Chi (or pushing hands exercise). The pushing force may be delivered through the fingers, but you have to be well rooted for this to work."
1196,岬,"headland",1,2016-06-22 11:51:07,"Think of a mountain putting its roots out to sea. Like the way you see some tree roots that go overground.
If you think this way, of the roots spreading out rather than going straight down, you'll remember that the two primitives go side by side (not mountain on root)"
1197,挿,"insert",1,2016-06-30 10:41:36,"Cthulu goes bowling, inserting his fingers into a thousand different bowling balls, rooting them solidly in the holes before smashing everything around him with them.
One touch from Cthulu's finger and he will insert a thousand horrors that root down into your brain and turn you insane."

At least this works to distinguish #most# people from monkeys...."
1202,果,"fruit",1,2016-06-21 19:58:52,"The easiest way to remember this is to draw it with proper stroke order. Then it tells the tale of ""fruit"":

sun over horizon (makes fruit grow)
vertical line going through gives ten fields (seeds have potential for 10 fields)
final two strokes make a tree so we see picture of seed grown up and at the same time, there's that potential for a whole field of fruit growing at the top."
1203,菓,"confectionary",1,2016-06-21 19:59:37,"Use flowers and fruit to make sweet desserts. There are a lot of edible flowers used in making confections."

I suppose Adam and Eve, cloaked just in a fruit to hide nakedness.

Strange that it's cloak-fruit, not flesh-fruit. Think of ""wearing only an apple"""

1208,所,"place",1,2016-06-22 18:16:36,"Everyone's welcome at my place so long as they leave their axe outside by the door.
Anyway, very commonly-used kanji (ところ)
ところで、would you mind leaving your axe by the door?"

1210,近,"near",1,2016-06-22 18:20:17,"Very close to environs, both in meaning and composition. Assume that ""near"" is nearer than the wider ""environs"". So imagine a hatchet with a short haft so its reach is less than that of the sword in ""environs""."
1211,折,"fold",1,2016-06-22 18:20:58,"finger-axe
Imagine an origami guitar (axe)"
1212,哲,"philosophy",1,2016-06-22 18:24:32,"Learn this one together with ""vow"". A vow then is the specific utterance (using ""say""), which might be seen as a practical application of philosophy, and this is just the mouth, so lets say that it encompasses all aspects of philosophy that could be said (or thought, imagined)..
Think of ""fold"" as ""enfolding"", like an ""all-enfolding"" system of thought and you have the idea of philosophy."
1213,逝,"departed",1,2016-06-22 18:30:25,"Think of space travel. Space drive must fold space (the road they're travelling on) to avoid problem of relativity (max speed = c). Still, takes tens of years to reach destination, so at the departure everyone is sad, like it's a funeral for the departed."
1214,誓,"vow",1,2016-06-22 18:32:38,"Paired with story from philosophy. A vow is an all-enfolding (all-encapsulating) utterance, something you say to show that you're actually serious about following your personal philosophy."
1215,斬,"chop off",1,2016-06-22 18:35:14,"It probably would have been too hard to find a different left-side for this kanji since ""tree""is already used (in chop) and flesh wouldn't really be intuitive.
So you can chop wheels of the car with the axe and it becomes like a palanquin. Or you could chop off the outside horizontal stroke and it would become a monkey!"
1216,暫,"temporarily",1,2016-06-22 18:40:11,"Think of a work roster or a travel itinerary marked up in a calender. If you chop days off it, then you're temporarily stuck until you reschedule things. Think ""temporarily"" as having to do with time (in fact, it comes from the Latin ""Tempus"", meaning time)
Alt: If your car gets the chop, your insurance company may temporarily give you a new one for the few days it takes to repair yours."
1217,漸,"steadily",1,2016-06-22 18:41:37,"water + chop off
Think of a slower kind of chopping off: erosion by water. It may not be as quick, but the water steadily chops off even the hardest material."
1218,断,"severance",1,2016-06-23 11:10:08,"Think severance/redundancy pay. A particularly mean-spirited employer lets you take all the rice you can pick up with a straightened hook after giving you the axe."
1219,質,"substance",1,2016-06-22 18:47:19,"A very common kanji, appearing in 質問 (shitsumon, a question)
Think ""substantive"" or a person or topic of substance/import.
Think of the two axes as representing two things: one for general living/livelihood (to cut trees for firewood, building) and the other representing warfare or self-defence (say against criminals). These are two substantive issues that the common man is always concerned about, but the main thing people are worried about is MONEY."
1220,斥,"reject",1,2016-06-22 18:50:54,"Axe with a drop. Many possible defects that an axe can have (the drop modifying it in some way) and any one is a potential reason to reject it.
Think manufacturing reject: this axe fails quality control for some reason."

1223,詐,"lie",1,2016-06-22 18:57:13,"We use the expression of digging a hole for ourselves if we start a lie and keep going. Imagine instead that we're on a tree (not pictured) and we start to saw the branch we're sitting on. Kind of like shooting ourselves in the foot if we keep saying the same lie and embellishing with each retelling.
Also, as someone noted, look at ""to make"" and see ""words that are made up""."
1224,作,"make",1,2016-06-22 19:00:19,"Gay ATC guy in Airplane! film. ""What can you make of this? ... brooch, pterodactyl, etc."" Well, Hiro can make a cabinet, a musical instrument, sandwiches, ..."

1226,録,"record",1,2016-06-22 19:04:32,"Think of a criminal record as something tarnishing your reputation (the metal bit) and then imagine the broom brushing away all the rice-grains making the metal all shiny and clean again. Also imagine ""time served"" in prison as being all about this kind of thing, with your release meaning that you're fit to be a member of society again, your debt to society cleared."
1227,剥,"peel off",1,2016-06-22 19:06:16,"Same idea for broom + rice grains in ""record"", but this time imagine sand-blasting (pumping a mix of water + sand, or in this case, rice-grains, at high pressure) to peel off outer layer of crud from something."
1228,尋,"inquire",1,2016-06-22 19:08:41,"Top, broom, sweeps away various alternative conversational topics. Bottom three together indicate crafting a specific utterance that sticks the person into having to answer one thing. Think of a politician in an interview. They want to duck the question, so you have to keep repeating this process of inquiry until they give you a direct answer."
1229,急,"hurry",1,2016-06-22 19:10:05,"X-over heart is usually a mood or something like that. I was in such a hurry to finished cleaning the house that I tied all my brooms together so that the job would be finished quicker."
1230,穏,"calm",1,2016-06-22 19:13:01,"Kanji looks quite tranquil/calm. Wheat growing in the field, a vulture perched above, not bothered by you/you not bothering it while you get into the flow of just cleaning up with your broom.
Think of heart as first part and work out from there."
1231,侵,"encroach",1,2016-06-22 19:15:02,"I'm thinking of three elements on the right as like loss of control/letting go. Your crown has been swept off (broom standing for ""swept off"") and has landed on your crotch.
When a person approaches you in this kind of vulnerable state, they are encroaching on your personal space."
1232,浸,"immersed",1,2016-06-22 19:20:06,"water + loss of control/letting go (or water + ""discombobulation"")
Immersed can either mean that you've let yourself go and have gotten into the flow of something, or it could mean being immersed in something without your will. Either way, water + discombobulation seems to work OK as a mnemonic."
1233,寝,"lie down",1,2016-06-22 19:23:40,"""lie down"" in the sense of lying down to go sleep.
Under a roof, so this is a normal bedtime.
Turtle stands for portent, so a hint of dreams to come. Discombobulation like an overturning of the regular order. Either you're deliberately letting go, inviting the turtle to bring you dreams, or you have no choice and you fall asleep regardless, allowing the (more literal) turtle to invade your mind."
1234,婦,"lady",1,2016-06-22 21:27:53,"Woman, broom/apron.
Ah, the perfect lady (so much for women's lib in kanji!)
Methinks the lady doth protest too much if she thinks she shouldn't be sweeping the floor dressed only in an apron."
1235,掃,"sweep",1,2016-06-26 17:33:39,"zoom in on the kanji for ""lady"" and we see her fingers holding the broom, doing her sweeping chores.
fingers, broom, apron"
1236,当,"hit",1,2016-06-23 12:01:42,"Remember the Atari games company? Well, one reading for that is 当たり. Now think about the Atari logo which can be seen by (a) taking the top part and turning it upside-down, or (b) rotating the bottom part 90 degrees left, removing the top line and spreading the two sides out along the bottom.
Oh, Atari means ""hit"". They had lots of hit games."
1237,彙,"glossary",1,2016-06-22 19:31:45,"Instead of ""broom"" here, think of it as ""mutually"" (互) with a bit lopped off.
Next, imagine reading a book that needs a glossary, say a Japanese book that has vocab explanations for English speakers. So the lopped-off ""mutually"" suggests that this glossary only goes one way, from JA -> EN.
Next, consider ""fruit"" underneath as having the meaning of ""chapter"" (no ""say"").
So we have a Japanese text where we have a one-way (not mutual) glossary ""crowning"" each chapter."
1238,争,"contend",1,2016-06-22 19:35:45,"bound-up rake
Think of contenders in a gladiatorial ring. One guy has something that looks like a rake (a trident, perhaps) and the other guy has bound it up by sticking something like a sai or jitte through it. (types of weapons that are mostly used for grappling/locking an opponent's weapon)
(""I coulda been a contender"" transplanted to ancient Rome, in other words)"
1239,浄,"clean",1,2016-06-27 20:33:57,"Think ""contention"" for the right and imagine a ""bone of contention"" is what is binding up the rake/trident. 
This kanji has meanings like cleanse, purify or exorcise so imagine the water as metaphorically exorcising the bone of contention between two people. Or think of using the rake of contention to clean out your teeth."
1240,事,"matter",1,2016-06-22 15:16:52,"Japanese use this all the time in conversation, like ""そう言う事"" (""that thing/matter that you say""). It's like a form of focusing, turning some abstract thing into a more concrete thing within the context of the conversation.
With that in mind, I think one-mouthful-rake: gathering up a pile of ideas/speech into one (mental) mouthful with a rake."
1241,唐,"T'ang",1,2016-06-22 15:25:41,"Bat-cave quite often appears in relation to governments (municipality, courtyard, government office), so I suppose it's not too hard to remember here.
I read about the T'ang dynasty on Wikipedia and it describes it as being a period of great prosperity and population growth, with influences further afield than most other Chinese dynasties.
I'm going bat-cave for some sort of officialdom, rake to symbolise both agricultural advances, and mouth to symbolise population growth."
1242,糖,"sugar",1,2016-06-22 15:29:33,"As it happens, sugar was first grown on a large scale in China during the Tang dynasty: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty#Tea.2C_food.2C_and_necessities
I'm guessing that it's rice on the left rather than wheat because sugar cane production needs lots of water (same as rice)."

Anyway, rake + rice-grains does suggest sieving/winnowing quite easily."
1244,逮,"apprehend",1,2016-06-30 10:13:56,"Kanji has both meanings: apprehend and chase. I think that chase gives a better reason why we have the roadway, but I'll just file that away for now.
You hear of people ""combing"" an area to apprehend a suspect, but I guess that the Japanese would rather ""sieve"" the area.
I confuse this with ""intercept"" all the time. The kanji for sieve kind of looks like a Segway, so with that as a clue, I'll say that it's easier to apprehend someone if they're trying to get away on one."
1245,伊,"Italy",1,2016-06-22 19:45:09,"No jobs in Italy, apparently. Everyone just gets a mop and has to keep all those Roman ruins clean for the tourists. Imagine a person goofing around and putting the mop on his head, pretending he's in the Beatles."
1246,君,"old boy",1,2016-06-22 19:47:33,"きみ
mop over mouth. Imagine in the 60s/70s when long hair came into fashion and all the ""old boys"" (more like ""young men"", but whatever; keyword is what it is) had hairstyles like mops that covered everything above their mouths."

1250,儒,"Confucian",1,2016-06-22 19:56:02,"Confucius say ""wise man no try catch rain with comb"" (nor play leapfrog with unicorn, but that's a different story, kanji #11493)"

1252,両,"both",1,2016-06-22 20:06:42,"Reminds me of the classic Greek figure/figure design (Greek Key/Meander), especially the version where T shapes interlock from both sides. We see something similar here with the kanji for ""mountain"" appearing inside and also appearing rotated 180 degrees above it.
In Greece, this was often used to decorate ceilings, so start drawing this kanji from there."
1253,満,"full",1,2016-06-22 20:12:33,"I think of fullness of expression, understanding, or whatever.
You can define a plant as ""needing water"" (a purely physical interpretation) or ""producing flowers"" (an emotional or metaphorical one) but the fullest explanation/understanding needs to incorporate both."
1254,画,"brush-stroke",1,2016-06-22 20:16:47,"Similar to the story for ""full"". There is the physical aspect of the ink ""shooting up"" onto the canvas, but there's also this empty space giving rise to the act itself, giving the idea of a ""pregnant void"" and the spontaneous nature of the stroke itself.
A lovely kanji."
1255,歯,"tooth",1,2016-06-22 20:19:52,"Think of a pair of molars. The top one ""stomps down"" (think ""footprint"") onto the rice cupped in the bottom one (think of it as zooming in on the middle three strokes of ""concave"" rather than Heisig's suggestion of ""shovel"")."
1256,曲,"bend",1,2016-06-22 20:21:41,"Bending a note on a guitar by stretching them out of place on the fretboard (thus changing the tension, and hence the pitch)"
1257,曹,"cadet",1,2016-06-22 20:26:37,"Think of a cadet school, where camaraderie is built up by a communal ""bending together"" to their tasks over the days. The one at the top indicates their unity of spirit and fellow-feeling for each other. 
The kanji also has meaning of comrade, fellow as well as office/official, so I'm using ""camaraderie"" as a useful interpretation in the kanji that follow."
1258,遭,"encounter",1,2016-06-22 20:27:17,"Cadets have an encounter on the roadway. It's a feeling of meeting a fellow-traveller."

1260,槽,"vat",1,2016-06-22 20:30:35,"In the same way that cadets are taught to pull together (being in it for the team instead of their own selfish ends) and mature, vats are used to mature wines and spirits so that harsh notes are eliminated and more well-rounded character develops.
Raw material of vats is wood, obviously."
1261,斗,"Big Dipper",1,2016-06-22 20:32:17,"Interesting that the first two strokes are the dots. Dots in a clear white page. Stars in reverse. One line obviously points north, the other indicates our bearing in relation to it.
Of course, ursa major looks like a dipper, so measuring cup (or scoop) is apt."
1262,料,"fee",1,2016-06-22 20:39:11,"Also ""materials"" as in 材料 (ingredients/materials). Imagine paying labourers at least part of their fee in cups of rice. Or maybe the farmer charges them a fee for meals! (Holiday in Cambodia: ""you'll work harder with a gun in your back for a bowl of rice a day"")
Also, think of interpretation of strokes in Big Dipper as representing a kind of ""reckoning"". In navigation, the meaning is obvious, but also here the amount of the fee is reckoned by what's fair/what the fee-setter thinks he can get away with."
1263,科,"department",1,2016-06-22 20:40:51,"Imagine laureates resting on their laurels (imagine wheat in this role) and everyone in the department measured up on this basis (with a big measuring scoop because they're obviously such a big deal)"
1264,図,"map",1,2016-06-22 20:42:32,"pent-in big dipper. Every map has an embedded idea of north and provides a means of reckoning how to get from A to B.

There are different degrees, with the deeper caverns being pretty much fatal.

1279,渡,"transit",1,2016-06-23 13:53:59,"Think of a barge transiting a canal to get from one place to another. With water + degree, you get the idea of Plimsoll line which marks the degree to which the boat is laden down.

1473,網,"netting",0,2016-06-25 16:22:52,"This is also the kanji for ""network"", so think of ""On the net, no-one knows you're a dog"". Now imagine Anonymous going around and netting all the animals that are using the net illegally. They throw a glass dome over them and wait until they've perished. They only catch animals that way (hence the horns), not humans, so you've nothing to worry about (unless you're an animal, that is)."
1474,緊,"tense",1,2016-06-25 16:35:10,"Loincloth-thread
The slave was a bit tense as he stood awaiting inspection with the rest of the slaves. He hoped that the pubic hairs sticking out from the bottom of his loincloth would be mistaken for a loose thread."

1476,縛,"truss",1,2016-06-25 16:46:55,"Anyone else wonder what sense of the word truss we're supposed to use here? Anyway, thanks to whoever said しばり. So, rope + acupuncturist, sounds like someone who's afraid of needles and has to be trussed up. Or a pregnant woman trussed up in a stirrup while the acupuncturist takes on the role of anaesthetist."
1477,縄,"straw rope",1,2016-06-25 16:48:42,"They use these in Shinto shrines, apparently, to ward off evil spirits. I think the right-side is meant to refer to amphibians like naga, kappa and the like."
1478,幼,"infancy",1,2016-06-25 16:52:31,"cocoon-power. Think about the film Cocoon. By getting in the swimming pool with the alien cocoons, the old folk regain their strength/youth. They didn't quite go back to infancy as it would have killed the aliens."

To help remember this abstract concept, consider ""mechanism"" and Lord Kelvin's comment: ""when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind"""
1482,機,"mechanism",1,2016-06-25 17:07:41,"Contraption has the sense of something quite primitive, maybe even built that way because of a religious belief (eg, Amish). When I think ""mechanism"", I think of ""mechanic"" and ""engineer"", both of whom have to work things out in terms of numbers first (so using an abacus, if you will). Think a Difference Engine build entirely from wood."

Dictionary definition of the kanji is either mysterious or occult. Hard to fault Heisig for picking mysterious here, but as a primitive it's very hard to fit when it goes in other kanji or vocabulary..."
1485,畜,"livestock",1,2016-06-25 17:39:16,"There's nothing especially deep or mysterious about why the domestic animals of the fields are so docile: we've been breeding them that way for countless centuries.

1504,零,"zero",1,2016-06-26 12:33:46,"rain over orders. Kanji initially meant  ""a little rain"", but became a true zero in positional number system in 1248CE. Consider rain that's so light that it won't even smudge the hanko mark on your orders. Effectively nil (epsilon instead of zero)."
1505,齢,"age",1,2016-06-26 12:37:47,"tooth, orders 
think of milk teeth being followed by adult teeth, followed perhaps by false teeth. I know it's ""orders"", not order, but I'll allow that fudge here, considering that the natural ordering of these types of teeth gives a very rough indication of age."

chibimizuno's idea of ""hi-ma"" is doubtful since the stroke order is spoon, dart, ...

Doubt about whether it's going to be a liquid (water) or more solid (ice) state. I always have this problem when making Bechamel sauce. It's either too liquid or too solid. No doubt if I measured my ingredients it would congeal to the right consistency (more like ice than water)."
1516,範,"pattern",1,2016-06-26 13:28:34,"Heisig calls this a ""fingerprint"", but really it's just another version of the ""seal"" radical.
I'll stick with fingerprint, though, because it does help to have the separate keyword.
Dictionary gives ""pattern, example, model"".
I'm going to go with the idea of one of Sherlock Holme's treatises, like that on tobacco ash or soil composition. In this case, he examines the patterns left by the bamboo rims of carriages and uses them to extract a unique fingerprint for each car, tying them to the crime scene."
1517,犯,"crime",1,2016-06-26 13:30:53,"pack of wild dogs, fingerprint
This crime has all the hallmarks of having been carried out by a pack of wild dogs, but instead of paw-prints, we found human fingerprints. Therefore, the crime must have been committed by werewolves!

1518,氾,"widespread",1,2016-06-26 13:33:42,"water-fingerprint

1524,怨,"grudge",1,2016-06-26 13:58:15,"呪怨 (じゅおん, idiomatic reading?) is the Japanese film ""The Grudge""
mailbox/heart: Film is all about haunting of a particular address, but forget about the roof part of address and remember how the various scenes of haunting made your heart race.
I guess you could also mix in some imagery from ""Ringu"", another horror. Instead of girl coming out of tv, imagine the boy from The Grudge crawling out of a mailbox, giving you a heart attack."
1525,柳,"willow",1,2016-06-26 14:11:13,"I'll go with ""sign of the hare"" for the right side since it turns up later as kanji #2199

1527,留,"detain",1,2016-06-26 14:22:14,"(receipt | dagger) / rice field
Actually, this is also ""sign of the hare"" at the top, but Heisig reads the right side as ""dagger"" instead of ""stamp"".
I met the White Rabbit (From Alice books) in the rice field, but I couldn't detain him since he was running late."
1528,瑠,"ultramarine",1,2016-06-26 14:36:48,"jewel | detain
This is the kanji for ""Lapis Lazuli"". Heisig seems to be confusing this with 琉 which he calls lapis lazuli, but is actually a precious stone/gem.
I'll rename this to ""ultramarine"", since that's a colour derived from lapis lazuli. It's used in Girl with a Pearl Earring, so I'll say that the #king detained# that girl because he thought she stole the earring."
1529,貿,"trade",1,2016-06-26 14:43:09,"Sign of the hare / shell

1530,印,"stamp",1,2016-06-26 14:54:24,"staple-stamp/seal
I imagine the left side more like an Iron Maiden, specially designed to put perforations on stamps (rhs). So actually, this also gives a double meaning of ""stamping holes in a stamp"".
This kanji is a very generic one for all kinds of stamps/seals. The actual Japanese word for a postage stamp is 切手 （きって）"
1531,臼,"mortar",1,2016-06-26 14:58:22,"Continuing with the idea that the LHS looks like an iron maiden, then reflect it and gives a similar idea. Although a mortar is different (needs a pestle), this reminds me of those iron maiden devices used for grinding herbal cannabis. So although the mechanics are different, the end result is just like using a pestle and mortar.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Crusher_for_tobacco_or_mariuhana_%281%29.JPG
Also, be sure to look up stroke order for this. It's a little surprising!"
1532,毀,"break",1,2016-06-29 11:24:33,"(mortar / soil ) | missile
Getting back to literal meaning of mortar, the purpose is to break something into a dust (soil), while the ""missile"" on the right is the pestle. Think of breaking up things like mustard/coriander/pepper seeds/salt crystals."
1533,興,"entertain",1,2016-06-26 15:11:22,"Note that unlike ""mortar"", which is essentially written top to bottom, this is done in stages. Just look up stroke order. Also, note the two extra horizontal lines!
mortar containing ""same"", incorporating ""tool-bench"" at bottom.
I just think of it as a pictograph of a kick-ass entertainment system with speakers on the side, then a DVD player/TV screen in the middle (same unit) and dainty animal legs at the bottom."
1534,酉,"sign of the bird",1,2016-06-26 15:16:06,"Well you could think ""one finger up at the top, four down"" as a kind of ""sign of the bird"". The rest could be your fist and a cuff/wrist watch.

1538,酵,"fermentation",1,2016-06-26 15:39:16,"whiskey | filial piety

1541,酪,"dairy products",1,2016-06-26 16:03:15,"whiskey-each
This kanji has various senses: dairy products, whey, broth, fruit juice
In all cases, the word ""liquor"" could be used in its broadest sense as ""a liquid produced or used in a process"", so this means a liquor, as used in each of the senses/processes listed."
1542,酢,"vinegar",1,2016-06-26 16:07:12,"I like the idea of ""yesterday's sake, now vinegar"", though feeling like a saw going down one's throat is good, too."

1546,猶,"waver",1,2016-06-26 16:48:37,"Weird. WWWDic lists the meaning as only ""furthermore, still, yet"", but another page I found gives it both the meaning of a (temporary) waiver, or to waver (hesitate, delay). Looking up compounds shows the main meaning is like a stay of execution (a temporary waiver) but also some of the other meanings...
Anyway, RHS is ""Chieftain"" and I'm wavering between whether the pack of wild dogs is attacking the chieftain or if he is their chieftain. I'll waive my decision for now."
1547,尊,"revered",1,2016-06-26 16:51:12,"Chieftain over glue. Chief Vitalstatistix is much revered by his followers in their Gaulish village. He is frequently seen being carried on top of a large shield, though he does have to be glued to it to prevent him from falling off."
1548,豆,"beans",1,2016-06-26 17:04:23,"Pictographically, this could be like a bean in a pod, or, for a short person, consider those ""you must be this high to ride"" signs, and the guy obviously failing to reach that bar despite standing up to his full height.
I'm going with midget as a primitive, since that's one of the other meanings of the kanji."
1549,頭,"head",1,2016-06-26 17:07:06,"bean | head
Bean as slang for brain/common sense (also ""beanie hat"" comes from the same place). Having your bean in your head is a pretty common-sense place for it."

1554,樹,"timber-trees",1,2016-06-27 17:46:27,"Think of this as ""town"" with a drummer in the middle. My story for town is that the town uses chipboard (wood + glue) for its building needs, so we have the same idea of quick-growing trees, but this time we have the drummer, who is perhaps there to make the trees grow quicker (or impart a sense of urgency)"

1660,静,"quiet",1,2016-06-29 13:21:26,"blue | contend
Some times you just want some quiet time. If you're blue, you just want to be able to contend with it in your own way."
1661,責,"blame",1,2016-06-29 13:22:52,"grow up / shell
When you grow up, you won't have anyone but yourself to blame for not having money: you should just quit whining and get a job."

The poor volume of wheat produced this year is blamed for the rise in the price of bread and other essential foodstuffs."
1664,債,"bond",1,2016-06-29 13:33:56,"Hiro | blame
How often have you heard ""the value of investments may rise or fall"" or the like? Well if Hiro invests in the stock market instead of bonds (which pay a fixed interest rate) then he's got nobody but himself to blame. (of course, this kind of doesn't work for Hiro since he's a time traveller, but still...)"
1665,漬,"pickling",1,2016-06-29 13:37:14,"water-blame
Too much moisture is often to blame if your pickling doesn't go right.
You need to use plenty of salt to draw excess moisture out before pickling in a strong brine. At least for making kimchi/sauerkraut, you do. The initial salting kills unwanted anaerobic bacteria as well as helping preserve crunchiness."
1666,表,"surface",1,2016-06-29 13:40:18,"grow-up / scarf
I grew up with the legend of St. Brigid's cloak, which we'll call a scarf here since it's on the bottom. Apparently she went to the king and asked for a plot of land and he told her she could have as much ""surface"" (area) as her scarf (cloak) would cover. When she set it down on the ground, it grew and covered a huge surface area (the Curragh in Kildare)."
1667,俵,"bag",1,2016-06-29 13:42:08,"Hiro | Surface
When Hiro travels through time, he doesn't need to pack a travel bag. If he needs something, he can just resurface in his own time, get it and pop back again."
1668,潔,"undefiled",1,2016-06-29 14:50:56,"water | ( (grow up | dagger) / thread)
See next kanji (pledge) for ""grow up | dagger"" as a tally/seal.
Now imagine the pledge is being carried out faithfully/gallantly by both sides. The water indicates plain sailing and the thread probably means that the two sides are still bound up in their contract/pledge.
So anyway, it's the contract/pledge that is undefiled."
1669,契,"pledge",1,2016-06-29 14:47:45,"Going with the idea of ""tally"" as in 契印: Impression of a seal over the joint of two papers, tally.
The idea is that a seal is placed across two copies of a document, then it's broken and each side keeps their copy. If the two halves are put together again, you can prove that the two sides match and so, I guess, hold the other side to their pledge.
For that to work, I'll say that ""grow up"" is the seal (something that grown-ups use) and the dagger is cut. All supervised by some big-wig (court official)"
1670,喫,"consume",1,2016-06-29 14:53:41,"mouth | pledge
Think ""over-consume"" and you pledge not to put so much in your mouth in future."
1671,害,"harm",1,2016-06-29 15:07:06,"house/grow up/mouth

1672,轄,"control",1,2016-06-29 15:10:14,"Drunk, car drivers don't think about the harm they can cause. They think that they're in control, but they're not."

""We are all in the gutter (like whiskey drinkers), but some of us are looking at the stars"" Oscar Wilde.

1680,牲,"animal sacrifice",1,2016-06-29 15:38:31,"cow-life
A cow's life is a dogs life, apparently, if they're going to be an animal sacrifice."
1681,産,"products",1,2016-06-29 15:45:09,"standing on cliff / life
We are the product of our own experience and upbringing. Imagine the bottom of the cliff is a rubbish tip. Now consider the difference between the guy standing at the top and the life of the guy who has to live down below (I'm reminded, eg, of people who live off rubbish tips in India, recycling whatever products they can). Maybe the person at the top is also metaphorically standing on a cliff ... what if the underclass has enough and wants change?"
1682,隆,"hump",1,2016-06-29 15:51:22,"Pinnacle | (walking legs / living)

1684,蜂,"bee",1,2016-06-29 15:58:23,"insect | furze bush
The great thing about furze bushes is that they're in flower practically the whole year, giving the bee a continual supply of pollen.

1687,寿,"longevity",1,2016-06-29 16:22:00,"Think of the longevity of Japanese people (above-average life-span). Some people think that this has to do with eating lots of seafoods, including seaweeds. Now note that this kanji is the one used in sushi (寿司) and treat that ""bush"" as a sea bush: Pyropia tenera that is used to make nori sheets (or laver bread, in Wales).
So, let the three top lines represent the bush/nori sheet, with the glue at the bottom being a bit of sticky rice used to glue the 巻き寿司 (rolled sushi) together."
1688,鋳,"casting",1,2016-06-29 16:29:33,"This is like ""die-casting"", which will probably be fairly obvious from the metal primitive.

I think that everyone has their own reality that is separate from everyone else's.

Only after that is it a counter for spindles.
So I'm going to use the word ""catenary"" (mathematical term) to remember this: The metal is like a sinker on a fishing line. The droop is the catenary (mathematical description of the curve/droop of the line), and the spindle is what you reel the fish in with."

Part of 簡単, a full word for simple. Never knew that that clacking bamboo thing was called ししおどし. Apparently it's used to scare away birds.

Also, a tsurugi (this kanji) is a double-bladed weapon, whereas a sabre has only one blade. I'm going to call both this kanji and the primitive on the LHS ""tsurugi"".
Top three strokes as ""meeting"": a long, straight sword can find meeting points between armour or bones (puncture weapon). Bisected mouth: two-bladed. Bottom two strokes: handle and tsuba (sword guard). Right side: a type of blade."

1811,衝,"collide",1,2016-07-01 16:24:28,"heavy in boulevard
Think of Newtonian physics and momentum = velocity x mass The more massive (heavier), the harder it is to stop. Now send a heavy object, like a truck, down a narrow boulevard and stopping it is going to be hard, so if anything gets in the way, a collision is the likely outcome."
1812,薫,"fragrant",1,2016-07-01 16:27:04,"I think of furze bushes, whose blossoms have a very heavy (coconut-y) fragrance. These plants are extremely inflammable and in fact are often deliberately burned each year."

""Envy is wanting what someone else has. Jealousy is being worried that someone will take what you have."" So if jealousy is like an obstacle (石) between you and someone else (fearing that they'll take what you have), then why ""wanting what someone else has""?

The normal workings of the anarcho-syndicalist commune is that the executive officer for the week has to pull out each issue in turn (with fingers, because the boxes are so small) from its own little box and then to have a vote on it. A simple majority in the case of internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major issues.

1929,繊,"slender",1,2016-07-03 15:49:48,"thread | row in land fiesta
Think of ""tailor"" and the differences between this kanji. We have an extra thread to the left and instead of a garment inside (representing the tailor), we have ""row"". Now think of the other kanji meanings: slender, fine, thin kimono. The tailor has been challenged to use the finest cloth (most slender threads) for one particular harvest fiesta costume. The string is like the vertical weave and the row is the horizontal."
1930,霊,"spirits",1,2016-07-03 15:55:01,"rain / two / row

1945,殿,"Mr.",1,2016-07-03 17:18:46,"(flag/together) | missile
Consider ""missile"" as ""missive"" (same Latin root ""mittere"") to get the idea of sending a letter to someone and addressing it to Mr. such-and-such. (In fact, a missive is sent to one's inferiors and this kanji has a similar meaning)
Flag-together as a kind of lumpen-designation, used when the person receiving the missive doesn't have a more lofty title."

1949,耕,"till",1,2016-07-03 17:37:50,"Xmas tree | well

It helps to know the reading アク. Aku is the ""big bad"" in Samurai Jack. He was born in the vastness of space but he sounds like he comes from the heart of Asia (and was voiced by a Japanese voice actor).

Different stroke order to 用. This is down first, then across (like rice field).
Think of it as a modified rice field with weird angles in the corners so that your farm machinery gets bound up as you try to negotiate them.
It also helps to think of the other meanings of the kanji and see ""bound up"" as actually being an antler/horn."
1954,触,"contact",1,2016-07-03 18:04:13,"Think shrinking away after an initial contact. Then think of the left as ""antler"" and the right as a snail (虫 is actually used in that kanji: 蝸).

This kind of argument is said (delivered orally, left side) but it has to agree with the scrapbooks held by the law association (ie, precedents)."
1962,倫,"ethics",1,2016-07-03 18:43:16,"Plagiarism as a particular breach of ethics. When Hiro stole the Kensei sword, Stanley Kubrick demanded a meeting with the producers since they obviously stole the CRM-114 reference from Kubrick's scrapbook."

2189,屯,"barracks",1,2016-07-07 17:23:49,"was ""worm"" when used as a primitive.
I like the analogy with either the Worms or Starcraft PC games."
2190,且,"moreover",1,2016-07-10 16:53:05,"Moreover, if you have shelves, you can fit in more over the same floor footprint."
2191,藻,"seaweed",1,2016-07-07 17:29:46,"Similar arrangement to ""full"", ""clan"" and """"fall"". Tree with goods appears in ""winding"", ""manoeuvre"" and ""parch""
Use most of those associations to imagine a clan of mermen (and women) for whom seaweed (underwater tree) provides the full range of goods (food, clothing and materials, say) that they need to survive on."
2192,隷,"slave",1,2016-07-07 17:34:11,"Remember LHS from ""goodwill"". My story for that was that he showed good will by yawning at some slight that you perpetrated against him. Here we see the opposite, where he makes you sieve through crushed rock in the diamond mine all day."
2193,癒,"healing",1,2016-07-07 17:39:27,"I guess this implies a more ""holistic"" view of healing than ""heal"". The inside part has the meaning ""be superior"", so I suppose a holistic view of health and healing is superior to just taking pills to treat symptoms.
Sickness radical is obvious. Meeting of rules and heart suggests a mix of scientific rules with a ""good bedside manner"" or ""placebo effect"" or other ""spirit-boosting"" aspects."
2194,璽,"imperial seal",1,2016-07-07 17:55:08,"tool-bench, belt, walking stick, sheaves, jewel
specially-crafted (tool-bench), always in the emperor's belt, one direct line of descent (legitimisation) and four sheaves for tribute from directions (consequences).
Jewel at the bottom because it's carved from jade, probably."
2195,潟,"lagoon",1,2016-07-07 17:59:36,"water : water feature
mortar: like a crucible in the metaphorical sense
bound-up: not connected to the sea directly (like an oxbow lake is separated from a river)
fires: subject to higher temperature extremes
I think this might also refer to a tidal pool, but my dictionary isn't that good"
2196,丹,"cinnabar",1,2016-07-07 18:00:57,"rusty wreck of a boat. (although cinnabar contains mercury, not iron)"
2197,丑,"sign of the cow",1,2016-07-07 18:07:59,"similar to the stroke order in shika (deer). Or: straightened out dagger as first two strokes, then 2 underneath. Maybe the ancient Chinese liked Halal beef?"
2198,羞,"humiliate",1,2016-07-07 18:11:15,"wool over sign of the cow
Shorn the sheep was humiliated when his wool was cut off revealing an ""I ♥ Daisy"" tattoo. (Sheep loving cows? WTF!)"
2199,卯,"sign of the hare",1,2016-07-07 18:13:18,"I used this earlier in several kanji (eg, detain, trade, egg). Think of floppy hare ears and just learn the stroke order"
2200,巳,"sign of the snake",1,2016-07-07 18:16:49,"The CAK巳 was a LI巳!
e for 巳ND. I like.
OK, it's not drawn as a mouth (different stroke order), but you can think that the dangerous end of the snake is its mouth. The tail isn't that worrisome (unless it happens to be a boa constrictor)"
