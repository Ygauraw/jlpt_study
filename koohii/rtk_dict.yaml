  story: Represents the Buddhist idea of an impermanent self from the Sanskrit phrase
    "five skandhas". A skandha is "heap", "bundle", "grouping" or "aggregate", so
    actually that "mouth" underneath 5 actually represents the word "skandha".

  story: 'Decomposing "whirlwind into top-hat and wind...


    My Japanese gardener is very industrious but he doesn''t speak English well. When
    I asked him the other day to dig a pit, I went out later and found a huge mound
    of soil and a top hat beside it. When I lifted up the top hat, I heard a huge
    howling wind from under it. It seems that my gardener had misunderstood the scale
    of the pit that I wanted (more like a cavern!), but at least I am thankful that
    he put the top hat on top so that nobody would fall in.'

  story: 'I consider "rising clouds" more like something with a hidden motive force
    inside (the bottom two strokes, which I imagine to be a stylised circle revolving)
    with the two lines being "wave crests" (visible effects). You can relate to "rising
    clouds" if you think of the revolving part as being convection currents and the
    "wave crests as the clouds that rise up as a result..

    Here, the idea is simple. Revolutionary force goes to car wheels.'

  story: I think of this as being more like "praxis" (practice, not theory) when it
    appears in other kanji. The bottom part is this mysterious motive force in the
    universe that sends out periodic visible effects. Pairing with flower gives the
    idea of applying theory to the practical field of horticulture. Thus we get technique
    as being the practical application (here, in the fundamental field of horticulture)
    of our understandings of the deeper workings of the universe (eg, techniques of
    plant breeding).

  story: As with revolve and technique, at the bottom (the so-called "rising clouds"
    primitive) there is an invisible motive force (evaporation and convection) which
    gives rise to visible manifestations of that force (ie, clouds form). In this
    case, the top part is rain because we all know that clouds have the potential
    for rain within them (and we can't have a self-referential kanji where cloud defines
    itself, without relation to anything else).

  story: 'water + "beggar". "beggar" = sun casting a light on a "bound up empty spoon.
    So I think of the RHS as casting light on some sort of specific lack that''s begging
    to be fulfilled. Make sure not to picture a beggar lying down or you''ll get confused
    with beg.

    In this case, the lack is water, so this "beggar" character is thirsty as that''s
    the meaning "bound up" in his empty spoon in this context.

    Careful with drought (similar EN) and dwindle (kind of similar story)'

  story: '"metal-mirror. Speaks for itself, really. You need silver on the back of
    glass to make modern mirrors, though before it would be solid lumps of polished
    metal.

    For some reason, Heisig breaks down the primitive on the right as standing, sun/wagging
    tongue, human legs. That''s crazy given that "stand up" and "see" immediately
    gives the image of standing up and looking at yourself in a full-length mirror.'

  story: 'State of mind + Sir Humphrey/"former

    The state of mind of Sir Humphrey after being fired from his former job is just
    pure hate for everyone except himself. Probably just like Hitler after becoming
    a former art school student.

    Think also the book, 1984. I''m sure civil servants came up with the idea of the
    "two-minute hate." Or if not, they certainly administer it, wanting to instil
    this state of mind of hate in everyone.'

    I said that emotion is like a march of wordless mouths/ineffable words coming
    up. If you stew in this state of mind, you begin to shape it into thoughts like
    "I should have done" or "I shouldn''t have done"---the very image of remorse.

  story: 'Apparently the right side of this means "cut at intervals: trees are cut

    I''m going to assume that lacquer comes from trees (urushi tree in Japan) and
    that the sap (the water radical on the right) is collected in the same way that
    latex is gathered from rubber trees, with cuts made at intervals up the trunk.

    Looking up pictures for urushi tree does show regularly-spaced cuts, so I think
    this theory might be correct.'

  story: 'Hiro beside "full measure over tree

    We didn''t really appreciate Hiro''s full greatness until we saw the full measure
    of the danger he protected us from spewing from the mouth of that tree in "protect".

    Think "full greatness" -> "full measure" and then remember the full measure of
    difference between this and protect.(not a great difference)

    OR: you may not realise the full measure of a man''s greatness until he''s lynched
    in a tree (think of the death of Archimedes at the hands of a Roman soldier)'

    Those who adhere to the system of bamboo stick-fighting (kendo? SA stick fighting?)

    really being all that practical.

    In fact, kendo swords are actually made of four pieces of bamboo, held together

  story: If you have a hole in your roof, it's hard to tell where the leak is. You
    have to wait until it rains. Then, the drops that fall down will flag where the
    rain is coming through. You might even want to physically stick a little flag
    on the spot where the rain came through so that you'll know where it is when the
    rain stops and you can fix it.

    They are allowed to add this to all their "copy" (ie, packaging and advertising/merchandising
    material)'

    The easiest way to do this is to cut only a short part from the end of the rope

    is happening. The element of distraction is needed to get rid of the small part

  story: '"Continuing with the idea that the LHS looks like an iron maiden, then reflect
    it and gives a similar idea. Although a mortar is different (needs a pestle),
    this reminds me of those iron maiden devices used for grinding herbal cannabis.
    So although the mechanics are different, the end result is just like using a pestle
    and mortar.

  story: top/bottom also seen in fragrant. I'm going with idea of steam cooking something
    to retain as much flavour/nutrients as possible. So look at it like a steam cooker.
    Flower at the top could be something like a banana leaf (big and can cover the
    steamer) or the veg being steamed. The complete/water combo is maybe saying that
    the steam is completely locked in (or that small amount of water makes the food
    more "complete", nutritionally). Last line the bottom of the steamer so there's
    no direct heat from below.

  story: Remember LHS from "goodwill". My story for that was that he showed good will
    by yawning at some slight that you perpetrated against him. Here we see the opposite,
    where he makes you sieve through crushed rock in the diamond mine all day.

  story: 'I guess this implies a more "holistic" view of healing than "heal". The
    inside part has the meaning "be superior, so I suppose a holistic view of health
    and healing is superior to just taking pills to treat symptoms.

    Sickness radical is obvious. Meeting of rules and heart suggests a mix of scientific
    rules with a "good bedside manner" or "placebo effect" or other "spirit-boosting"
    aspects.'

    specially-crafted (tool-bench), always in the emperor''s belt, one direct line
    of descent (legitimisation) and four sheaves for tribute from directions (consequences).

    Jewel at the bottom because it''s carved from jade, probably.'

    OK, it''s not drawn as a mouth (different stroke order), but you can think that
    the dangerous end of the snake is its mouth. The tail isn''t that worrisome (unless
    it happens to be a boa constrictor)'
